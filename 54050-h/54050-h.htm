</div>
<p>Rosie is the name of the little girl whose
picture you see on the first page, with a
snowball in her hands. Of course her
name is Rosa really, but somehow we
always call her Rosie. Has she not a
bright, pretty, laughing little face, with
her blue eyes, and fair hair? She is a
fine strong little maiden into the bargain; a trifle wilful,
perhaps, and a good deal of a romp.</p>
<p>Last Christmas I was staying at Cranley Grange&mdash;Rosie&rsquo;s
home in the country,&mdash;when one morning at
breakfast her mamma said to me&mdash;&ldquo;Charlie is coming
home to-day; I can&rsquo;t go to meet him, my cough is so bad.
I wonder if you would mind driving down to the station,
and taking Rosie and Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie, who was the eldest son, and a great favourite of
mine, was coming home for his Christmas holidays. He
was about fourteen years old, while Rosie was only ten, and
Frank two years younger.</p>
<p>I said I should be delighted to go, thinking what a pleasant
drive it would be with those merry laughing children.
Little did I anticipate the trial to my nerves, and the succession
of frights, that were in store for me.</p>
<p>We were soon seated in the open wagonette, and off we
started. Though I should not say <i>seated</i>, for the children
scarcely sat down at all: they kept jumping up, changing
places, pushing each other, and playing all sorts of pranks.
I was in an agony of fear lest they should tumble out; and
during the whole drive, I sat with my arms extended, clutching
hold, sometimes of one, sometimes of the other, to save
them. This was fright number one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>At last we arrived at the station;&mdash;the children still in
uproarious spirits, though with cherry noses, as well as rosy
cheeks, from the cold. I must tell you that there was snow
upon the ground; and as, unluckily, we had ten minutes to
wait for the train, they began to amuse themselves by snowballing
each other. Frank set the example, and they found
it such fun that I scolded, and begged them to be quiet, in
vain. At last I observed Rosie standing quite at the end of
the platform, where the snow was thicker, and she had collected
a large snowball, which she held up in her hands.
As I looked at her, and thought what a pretty picture she
made, I noticed, in the landscape behind her, a little puff
of white smoke. It was the approaching train, at a distance
of not more than half a mile. I thought her position, at
the extremity of the platform, and just at the edge too,
terribly dangerous. And this may be called&mdash;fright
number two.</p>
<p>I had just opened my lips to call out to her that the train
was coming, when a whole handful of snow came dab into
my face, filling my mouth and eyes. It was that little rogue
Frank, who had crept close up to me, and playfully bestowed
upon my face the snow he had been collecting. Recovering
from the shock, I looked out again for Rosie. She was no
longer in the same place; but, quite beyond the platform,
and close upon the rails, I saw her kneeling down in the
snow. I screamed with all my might, and a railway porter
ran to her, whisked her up in his arms, and brought her
safely on to the platform again. This was fright number
three; and never, I think, before or since, have I been so
much frightened as I was for the moment.</p>
<p>Directly afterwards the train stopped, and Charlie
jumped out. When he heard of Rosie&rsquo;s danger, he scolded
her as if he had been a little grandfather, and his words
seemed to have much more weight than mine. I now
observed that Rosie had a tiny white rabbit in her arms,
and she told us that this was what she was picking up out of
the snow upon the rails. She thought it was quite excuse
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
enough for herself when she said:&mdash;&ldquo;Only think, Charlie
dear, haven&rsquo;t I saved the life of this pretty little rabbit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way home, Charlie sat in front and drove, with
the coachman beside him; but he contrived now and then
to turn his head a little, and keep up his lecture to his brother
and sister about their riotous behaviour all the way. Meanwhile
I sat quiet, rather humbled at observing how much
more respect they showed for the scolding they got from
their big brother than for mine. But of one thing I am
certain: nothing would ever induce me to take charge of
those two lively young people on an expedition of the
kind again.</p>

<h2 id="c4">A STORY OF A WOODEN HORSE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">IN WHICH WE MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A NICE LITTLE BOY, AND A PRETTY WOODEN HORSE.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-009dt.jpg" alt="T" width="102" height="117" />
</div>
<p>There stood once, in the good old time&mdash;that
is to say some fifteen years ago, which we may call ages for you, my
little readers, who have not yet lost your pretty first teeth;&mdash;there stood,
then, once, in a delightful valley, between Long-Pont and Savigny, in
France, a charming country house, surrounded by a wood, which spread along the bank of a
little winding river.</p>
<p>The house of which I speak was called a chateau&mdash;that
is, a castle&mdash;by the peasants of the neighbourhood. To
tell the truth, however, it was only a moderate-sized house;
but it was kept in excellent order, although a very old
building. In spite of its age, therefore, it wore a smiling
aspect, like the faces of those amiable and good grandmammas,
who smile at your pretty ways, my children.</p>
<p>Let us go in: I wish to make you acquainted with a
little companion, whom I hope you will love very much.
There he is with his mamma in the drawing-room, where
the window, opening to the ground, shows us a garden
beyond. At this moment he is repeating a fable to his
mother. It is one which teaches that pride is a great
fault; that we ought not to assume airs of superiority
towards the unhappy and humble, nor endeavour to
excite envy in their hearts; and that Providence, moreover,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
takes upon itself sometimes to punish those who do so.
This fable, as you have already guessed perhaps, is called&mdash;&ldquo;The
Oak and the Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img id="xxx1" src="images/i-010.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="802" />
<p class="pcap">THOSE OF MY READERS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BE DRESSED UP AS SOLDIERS&mdash;TURCOS
OR ZOUAVES.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>My little friend&rsquo;s attention from the first has been about
equally divided between the fable he is repeating and a
beautiful wooden horse, which stands fastened by the
bridle to a tree in the garden: but before the fable is
finished, it is evident that his thoughts are altogether
taken up by the horse. It is a pity; because, not attending
to the punishment of the oak, he will lose the moral of the
fable. But let us not be more severe on him than his
mamma, who does not seem much distressed about the
matter. Besides, who can keep the thoughts from wandering
sometimes, particularly during study?</p>
<p>This little boy&rsquo;s name is Maurice; a nice soft-sounding
name, I think; and he is five and a half years old. I am
not going to say, like some mammas I know,&mdash;&ldquo;This is
the most beautiful child in the world, and has fair curly hair,
great blue eyes, and little rosy lips.&rdquo; No! In our hearts
we&mdash;that is, his relations and friends&mdash;all considered little
Maurice to be Nature&rsquo;s masterpiece, but I won&rsquo;t describe
his beauty in detail; and only say that he had chestnut
hair and an intelligent face.</p>
<p>Those of my young readers who are accustomed to be
dressed up as soldiers&mdash;Turcos or Zouaves; or, if they are
girls, to be clothed in silk and velvet, would no doubt like
to know how my little friend was dressed. Well then,
his mamma did not let him wear such fine clothes as would
interfere with his exercise or his games. Perhaps some
of my elegantly dressed little readers would not care
to play with him when they hear that he wore neither velvet
nor fur, nor even a feather in his cap; but had simply a
jacket and trowsers, made of linen in summer, and of
warm cloth in winter. For all that, however, he was a
good little boy, and well brought up.</p>
<p>Directly he had repeated the last verse of the fable&mdash;which
he did without thinking at all of its meaning&mdash;Maurice
bounded off from the drawing-room into the garden.
In a moment he had unfastened the horse, and
placing his foot in the stirrup, had sprung on its back.
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Then he called out: &ldquo;Gee-up, Cressida! gee-up, my
friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cressida, after shaking its head and flowing mane,
started off at a gallop, putting out its legs in the most
graceful way imaginable. Because I have said that
Cressida was a wooden horse, you picture it to yourselves
perhaps as resembling other wooden horses that you have
seen,&mdash;pretty toy horses, no doubt: but either they have
been only rocking-horses, or they have just moved a little
means of some mechanism which does not produce the
real action of a horse. Cressida was like none of these;
but lifted up its legs one after the other with the grace and
elegance of a thoroughbred English horse.</p>
<p>Yes, certainly, for a horse made of wood, it was very
wonderful. It had a curving neck, a long black tail. The
muscles were marked, as you see in well-bred horses; the
chest was powerful, the head small, the ears delicate, the
eyes full of fire, and the skin was soft and glossy. Add to
all this that every time you stroked Cressida on the neck it
neighed joyously, and it obeyed the bridle like the most
docile Arab horse.</p>
<p>It had many other precious qualities; but were I to tell
you all, this book would not contain the description: I
should be obliged to make a second volume. I will only
add, therefore, that this wonderful horse could remain without
food or drink for any length of time that circumstances
might render convenient.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can give no precise details concerning
the birth, education, or infantine peculiarities of Cressida.
It would even be impossible to learn them now; for the
only person who knew anything about them&mdash;the old man
who gave the horse to my little friend&mdash;is no longer alive.
We know very little even of this old man himself. He was
a native of Nuremberg, an ancient city of Germany, where
it is supposed that clocks were first invented. It seems
that in his own country, Fritz&mdash;for that was the only name
we knew him by&mdash;had been considered an extraordinary
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
mechanician; and he was driven away from Nuremberg
through the jealousy and enmity of a rich and powerful
Burgomaster of the city, who had a turn for mechanical
inventions himself.</p>
<p>The invention upon which this Burgomaster most
prided himself, was an automaton, or wooden figure, of
a woman, which walked, and smirked, and smiled, like
a real lady; but he could not make her speak. Fritz, who
was then young, devoted himself to a similar work; and
made a figure representing a young peasant-girl, who
could say, &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; and inquire after your health;
and, if you took her by the hand, would look down with
admirable modesty and grace. The success of Fritz gave
great offence to the Burgomaster; and there grew up
between the two, first a rivalry, then an enmity, which at
last caused Fritz to leave the city.</p>
<p>When little Maurice first knew him, Fritz could hardly
have been less than seventy-five years old: he was so old
that his hair was quite white, his head shook a little, and
he only walked by the help of a stick. He lived as if he
was very poor, in a small cottage near the house of
Maurice&rsquo;s parents. Whenever Maurice saw him, the
little boy always wished him good morning, and stopped
to talk to him. Fritz was very much pleased with these
attentions, and began to feel a strong affection for the
child; who was not slow to return it.</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s instinct told him that Fritz was good and
unfortunate, deserving to be loved and pitied. And indeed
he did deserve pity. In the decline of his life, not only did
he live in poverty, but the peasants of the village he had
chosen for his retreat, hurt perhaps by the coldness and
reserve of his manners, used to laugh at him, and sometimes
insult him. The boys of the place, generally mischievous
and badly brought up, would run after him, and
mimicking his German accent, inquire whether he had a
cold in his head that he was obliged to speak through his
nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img id="xxx2" src="images/i-014.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="816" />
<p class="pcap">HE SHOWED MAURICE HOW TO SIT THE HORSE FIRMLY AND GRACEFULLY.</p>
</div>
<p>One summer evening, when Maurice and his parents
were in the garden, enjoying the freshness of the air and
the perfume of the flowers, they heard the bell ring at the
gate, and presently Fritz came up to them, leading by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
bridle a pretty little black horse. In few words the old
man explained the motive of his visit. He wished, before
leaving the world, to make Maurice a present of the
wooden horse which he had brought with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wooden horse!&rdquo; they all exclaimed, for they had
mistaken Cressida for a real live pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a being created by God,&rdquo; said Fritz, &ldquo;but
only a thing made of wood. By some mechanism, which
I will not explain to you, it is endowed with the action and
movements of a real horse. Cressida is what I possess
most precious in the world, and I have made up my
mind to part with it only because I love your little son,
and know he deserves to possess an object which I care
more for than I do for the few days of life that remain to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he explained to Maurice how to manage the horse;
how to make it move, and to guide it. He took the little
hand of the child and placed it softly on the pony&rsquo;s neck,
which immediately neighed as if with pleasure. He showed
Maurice how to sit the horse firmly and gracefully; and
when the little boy, who was very intelligent, understood
all this, Fritz told him he might start off. The child had
only to press his knees hard against the sides of Cressida,
and off it went at a gallop. The rider&rsquo;s heart beat quickly,
but he kept his seat, and guiding the pony back again,
pulled up at the spot he had started from.</p>
<p>Maurice&rsquo;s father and mother were lost in amazement;
they did not know how to show their gratitude, for Fritz
was not a man to offer money to. They begged him to
leave his cottage and come and live with them. Fritz
thanked them, but said that he intended in a few days to
leave the village to go to Nuremberg, and that at his age
he could hardly calculate upon returning. He was going
to see for the last time his niece and her three little children,
who were the only relations that remained to him.
This niece&rsquo;s husband had gone to America a year ago, to
settle there: he had been successful, and the wife and
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
children would follow him soon. Fritz said that before he
died he was going to see them once again.</p>
<p>On taking leave, Fritz asked Maurice to give him a
promise that he would never sell, or part with, Cressida.
&ldquo;Unless, indeed,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it should be for the sake of
helping somebody in great distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice had a stable arranged for Cressida in the house,
and acted as groom himself. He rose every morning at
six o&rsquo;clock, and went to clean and rub down his little horse,
which always stood quiet the time.</p>
<p>And now it occurs to me, my little readers, that you
would probably like to know the name of Maurice&rsquo;s father
and mother, which I have not yet told you. The father&rsquo;s
name was Felix de Roisel, and the mother was called
Julie. She was very pretty and very gentle: as gentle and
pretty a mamma as you have ever seen. Still she could be
severe if it was really necessary: but this was not often
with so good a child as my little friend.</p>

</div>
<p>Well, my little friends, I think I need hardly
describe <i>this</i> animal to you; for there is
scarcely a home in England, rich or poor,
which is without a pussy.</p>
<p>How the children all love the little kitten,
the nursery pet, with its pretty playful
ways and graceful movements! But kitty
grows up too soon into the sedate old mother-cat, like the
one we see in the picture holding the poor little mouse in
her mouth. Ah! that to me is a terrible drawback to
Pussy,&mdash;that love of killing.</p>
<p>I am so fond of cats that this year I went to the Crystal
Palace Cat Show, where I saw some beauties: among
others a tortoiseshell Tom, which is said to be a great
rarity. Hundreds of cats, large and small, long-haired
and short-haired, long-tailed and tailless, cats of every
colour known to catdom, filled the cages, which were
arranged in long rows. And I must say they bore their
imprisonment with wonderful patience. For three days
they had been shut up in those wire houses, like birds: and
some of the cages housed a whole family. One, I remember,
contained a mamma and her six children; the latter small,
but very rampageous. I pitied this poor mother with all
my heart: how her patience must have been tried during
those three dreadful days!</p>
<p>Though we may not like to see cats kill small animals,
Puss is often valued in proportion as she can rid the house
of rats and mice. So it is, I suspect, with the cat in the
picture. She is evidently owned by a carpenter, who
perhaps found his workshop infested by rats and mice till he
possessed this handsome tabby. She will soon rid him of
them, I think: and see how she is teaching her kittens to
follow her example!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>But in spite of their natural instinct to destroy mice and
birds, cats may be easily taught to live in friendship with
these very creatures; and I will tell you a story of a pet cat
which, I think, will amuse you better than hearing about the
poor little mice being killed.</p>
<p>A lady that I know had a fine tabby cat, and also a very
beautiful canary. The cat&rsquo;s name was Bijou; the canary&rsquo;s&mdash;Cherry.
Now Bijou had been brought up from kittenhood
with Cherry: that is, he had been accustomed to sit
on the rug beside the fire, while Cherry sang in his cage on
the table, or hanging at the window. Bijou always behaved
perfectly well, and never attempted to molest Cherry.</p>
<p>The mistress of these two pets used to let the canary fly
about sometimes in her bedroom, but she never had quite
confidence enough in Bijou to do this while he was there.
One day in summer the window of the bedroom happened
to be open at the top without her noticing it, and the
canary, after flying about the room a little while, passed out
of the window. It flew round and about, from tree to tree,
seeming to enjoy its liberty very much.</p>
<p>The lady feared she had lost it for ever, but she brought
out the cage and placed it upon the lawn, thinking there
was just a chance that the canary might come back to its
old home of its own accord. As she stood at the window
watching, she presently saw the bird alight on the lawn.
A moment afterwards she saw Bijou, who had been crouching
in a bed of flowers, spring out, pounce upon the little
creature, and seize it in his mouth.</p>
<p>Then, to the lady&rsquo;s astonishment, who expected to see
the bird devoured, Bijou trotted with it up to the cage, and
deposited the truant safely inside again. Cherry was dreadfully
frightened, but not at all hurt, and after shaking its
rumpled feathers into their places, sat on its perch as happy
as ever.</p>

<p>Peter was a little boy who was very fond of
birds and animals. He had a raven which
he taught to do all manner of tricks.
Trusty Tim&mdash;that was the raven&rsquo;s name&mdash;would
fetch and carry like a dog, and would
call upstairs to his master when anyone
came to the cottage door, like a housedog
barking. He would also help his master to pull off his
boots, by taking the toe in his beak and giving it a tug.</p>
<p>Like other clever people, however, Trusty Tim sometimes
made a mistake. One day Peter&rsquo;s little brother, Johnny,
put out his foot to see if the raven would do the same for
him. Unluckily there was a tiny hole at the toe of the
boot, and Trusty Tim could not resist the temptation of
pecking at the hole, and taking a little bit of Johnny&rsquo;s toe.
And didn&rsquo;t Johnny scream!</p>

<h2 id="c10">OTTO IN THE WATER-BOTTLE.
<br /><span class="small">A FAIRY STORY.</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-023di.jpg" alt="I" width="78" height="112" />
</div>
<p>It had been such a day! The flakes of snow
had been falling, falling like feathers on the
pavement all day long. It was now dark,
and little Otto stood at the dining-room window,
watching them still falling in the light
of the lamps outside. Otto is a handsome
boy of about seven years old. It is New
Year&rsquo;s Eve; and he is going to a party this evening.
Bertha, his sister, is being dressed for it at the present
time, but he had been so noisy and troublesome, up in the
nursery, while the ceremony of her dressing was going
on, that he was sent downstairs to wait till his turn came.</p>
<p>Otto had been to a good many parties, and to two
pantomimes this winter; still he was not at all tired of
either parties or pantomimes; on the contrary, the more
he went to the more he seemed to like them. But it was
only at Christmas Otto was so gay; for did he not do
lessons all the rest of the year with his sister&rsquo;s governess?
Miss Wigly was very strict, and thought children were
much better without many holidays;&mdash;&ldquo;particularly little
boys,&rdquo; she said. But perhaps that was because she was
so anxious to get Otto well forward before he went to
school.</p>
<p>For the last ten minutes he had been staring at the
snow outside the dining-room windows, then he turned
round and looked at the things in the room. A bright
fire blazed on the hearth, the cloth was already laid for the
dinner of the older members of the family, and by the side
of the fire stood a comfortable easy chair, which papa
generally sat in as soon as he had done his dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-024.jpg" alt="Reflections" width="500" height="650" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Otto seated himself in this chair, and began to look at
a bottle of water, which stood at the corner of the table
nearest to him. His attention was attracted by the odd
way in which things were reflected in the water. How
minute the reflections were, and how they all curved, so as
to make the room look round, as if seen in a mirror! He
observed, too, his own little face, sometimes lengthened,
sometimes widened, according to the part of the bottle he
saw it in. These observations did not prevent him from
thinking at the same time what a comfortable easy chair
he was sitting in, and what a nice warm fire it was.</p>
<p>How long he had been reflecting upon all these things
he never knew, when he observed, to his surprise, that the
bottle was growing bigger; and, in another moment,
instead of looking at it from the outside, he found himself
inside it, looking at the objects beyond. And these were
all changed. There was no water in the bottle now, but
the water was outside, and the bottle itself was floating
upon a river. The river seemed to wind along between
mountains, and had beautiful buildings and trees upon its
banks. A boat, rowed by two queer little men, was
fastened by a chain to the bottle; and, as they rowed, the
bottle was towed along. Gold and silver fish were playing
about in the water; tiny children with wings were sporting
in the air. The bottle inside was fitted up like an elegant
drawing-room; and&mdash;most wonderful of all!&mdash;a beautiful
fairy reclined on a sofa in the midst of it.</p>
<p>Otto knew she was a fairy, because she was just like
those he had seen at the play, dressed all in gold and
silver tissue, and sparkling with jewels. Besides, although
she looked grown-up, she was not bigger than Otto himself.
She spoke to him also in the beautiful language
used in plays:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortal child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thou lovest well to join in
the festivities of other mortals,&mdash;what sayest thou now to
making one in a fairy revel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fairy party, do you mean, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Otto.
&ldquo;It would be awfully jolly, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then, with me,&rdquo; said the fairy, rising from her
sofa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-026.jpg" alt="Fairy party" width="500" height="650" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>As she did so, it occurred to Otto that they would
wonder what had become of him at home. He hesitated,
and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I go back home for a minute first, if you please,
ma&rsquo;am, to let them know where I am? And I think my
sister, Bertha, would like very much to come too, if she
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortal boy, dost fear to trust thyself with us?&rdquo; exclaimed
the fairy, indignantly.</p>
<p>Otto felt he had offended her, but before he could reply,
she had disappeared. For a moment everything seemed
confused: &ldquo;Just like a change of scene in a pantomime,&rdquo;
thought Otto to himself. Afterwards, instead of floating
along upon the river, he found himself sitting upon its
bank, while a very large moon rose over the water.
Bertha was sitting by his side, and two lovely fairies stood
by them, but not the same fairy as before. In front of
him, standing up in the water, was a very shabby, damp-looking,
white-bearded old man. Otto was puzzled to
account for him at first, then he recollected to have seen
a picture somewhere of old Father Thames, and he assumed
that this old man must be the river-god. There
were also some little naked fairies hovering about him,
&ldquo;And those,&rdquo; thought Otto, &ldquo;must be little streams that
run into the river.&rdquo; Besides all these, there was a large
tortoise or turtle close to Otto, which crept up, and stared
him in the face.</p>
<p>The old man, addressing Bertha and Otto, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell
me, children, what is your wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Otto could put in a word, Bertha exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;I
want to go to the fairy revel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she seems to know all about it!&rdquo; thought Otto,
very much surprised. The words&mdash;fairy revel&mdash;uttered
by Bertha, were repeated by voices in the air, on the
earth, among the reeds, in the water, everywhere. Gradually
the sounds died away in the distance, and as they did
so, Otto discovered that he was alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-028.jpg" alt="Turtle steed" width="500" height="663" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they have all gone off to the fairy ball, and left
me behind,&rdquo; said Otto, aloud to himself. &ldquo;How shall I
ever get there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump on my back,&rdquo; cried a voice from the grass. It
was the tortoise: and Otto observed that it had a kind of
side-saddle on its back, and a bridle in its mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you go fast?&rdquo; said Otto, doubtingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try me!&rdquo; briefly replied Mr. Tortoise.</p>
<p>Otto did so, seating himself as he thought a lady-fairy
might do. Rather to his own surprise, he felt no alarm
when the creature rose up from the earth, and bore him
rushing through the air. He seemed to be rapidly approaching
the moon, when suddenly a harsh voice sounded
in his ears:&mdash;&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re not dressed.&rdquo; He looked at
himself, and perceived, to his dismay, that he had on his
nightgown. &ldquo;How stupid of me,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;why, I
must have jumped out of bed, and come off, without dressing.
What shall I do at the fairy ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the same great voice cried,&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
dressed,&rdquo; and the words were followed by a merry peal of
laughter. Otto looked at himself again, and now all was
changed: he had on his usual little jacket, his nickerbockers,
warm stockings, and shoes. He was in his
father&rsquo;s easy chair, and the water-bottle was on the table
before him. Bertha stood there, dressed for her party,
laughing with all her might; while Mrs. Crump the nurse
looked very cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nurse, why did you wake me? I was on my way
to the fairies&rsquo; ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairies&rsquo; fiddlestick!&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Crump. &ldquo;Come
and get dressed directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bertha, Bertha, I have had such a wonderful dream;
just like being at the play. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind now,&rdquo; replied Bertha, snubbing him
with all the importance of a sister three or four years his
senior. &ldquo;Make haste and dress, or we shan&rsquo;t go to Aunt
Julia&rsquo;s ball, which I care more about.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c12">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR.</h2>
<h3>WATER TURNED INTO WINE.</h3>
<p>Now, darling children, come round me while we have a
little talk fit for Sundays. You remember that during the
past year I gave you some account of our Saviour&rsquo;s teaching,
and of the principal events of His life. Now I shall
tell you about some of the miracles He performed.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Miracle&rdquo; signifies simply&mdash;wonder: but there
may, of course, be many wonderful events which are not
miracles. As the word is used, a miracle means strictly
an act by which the laws of nature are set aside: and
though the wisest of us do not understand all nature&rsquo;s
laws, we should be able, I think, generally to distinguish
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
what was really a miracle from what was merely wonderful.
For instance, if a doctor were to cure a blind man by
anointing his eyes, we might think it wonderful, but
should conclude that he had discovered a cure for that
kind of blindness. If the physician, however, were to give
sight to the blind man by merely commanding him to see,
we might then pronounce the cure a miracle.</p>
<p>The Jews expected that all who claimed to be prophets
should perform some miracle to prove that they were
divinely inspired; as did Moses, Elijah, Elisha, and
several of the prophets. When the divine promise was
given to Moses and others, that a great prophet should be
raised up for the people of Israel, it was foretold that this
prophet should be known by the greatness and variety of
the miracles which he performed.</p>
<p>By such signs he was to be distinguished from all
pretenders, and Isaiah says:&mdash;&ldquo;Then the eyes of the
blind shall be opened; and the ears of the deaf shall be
unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and
the tongue of the dumb sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our Saviour may be said generally to have had two
objects in performing miracles. In most instances, one
object was the immediate relief of suffering. But He
always had the greater object by His miracles of proving
that He was the Christ, whose coming had been foretold
to the Jews so long before. The miracles were the <i>signs</i>
that He was the Messiah.</p>
<p>The first miracle performed by our Saviour was that of
turning water into wine.</p>
<p>We are told by St. John that there was a marriage in
Cana of Galilee, and at the feast our Saviour and His
mother were present. After a time the servants found
that the supply of wine for the guests was running short.
One of them told this to the mother of Jesus, and she,
going to Him, said:&mdash;&ldquo;They have no wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miracle which followed is thus related in the words
of Scripture:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus saith unto them: Fill the water-pots with water.
And they filled them to the brim. And He saith unto
them: Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the
feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had
tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not
whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water
knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
and saith unto him: Every man at the beginning doth set
forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then
that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine
until now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first miracle that Jesus did: in our next
Sunday-talk, my children, I will tell you more of them.</p>

<h2 id="c13">ST. VALENTINE&rsquo;S DAY</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-036df.jpg" alt="I" width="65" height="142" />
</div>
<p>It was the thirteenth of February; to-morrow
would be St. Valentine&rsquo;s day; and the
children were as busy as bees preparing
valentines. They were as merry, too, as they
were busy; all except Annie&mdash;little Annie,
the delicate one, the pet of the family.
While the others were skipping and jumping
about as they did up their valentines, and
eager and noisy, as it is the nature of children
to be, Annie sat on the hearthrug, with
her hands clasped round her little knees,
staring into the red fire; and her pale face looked quite
old and wan from trouble.</p>
<p>I was very hard at work directing the envelopes for the
children, while they clamoured and clustered round me;
but looking at our dear little girl&rsquo;s wistful face, I took
advantage of a moment&rsquo;s respite from my work to go
and ask her what it was that seemed to trouble her so
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, auntie,&rdquo; she said, as she began to cry, &ldquo;it is
because Jack has taken my darling Tip away from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tip was a nice little Scotch terrier that belonged to
Annie&rsquo;s cousin, Jack, who had been staying for two or three
weeks at Annie&rsquo;s home during his holidays. Tip had come
on the visit with his master, and had gone away with
him only that morning. But during those two or three
weeks Tip and Annie had become dear friends and play-fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had taught him so many pretty tricks,&rdquo; continued
Annie, &ldquo;and he loved me so: I am sure, auntie dear, he
loved me better than Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, darling,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;after all Tip is Jack&rsquo;s own
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
doggie, and he is very fond of the little creature, you
know, so of course he took him away with him. Now,
dear, don&rsquo;t fret any more, but try and be cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie is a good little girl, and did try her best to be
cheerful, I could see. She came to the table, and looked
over the valentines with the others; but she had not forgotten
her sorrows.</p>
<p>Presently, her little brother Tommy said to her,&mdash;&ldquo;Annie,
don&rsquo;t you hope you&rsquo;ll get a jolly lot of valentines
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; sighed Annie, &ldquo;unless Tip could send
me one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What stuff!&rdquo; remarked Tommy: &ldquo;Tip can&rsquo;t send you
a valentine, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he might <i>bring</i> me one, at any rate,&rdquo; said Annie,
&ldquo;for I taught him to carry letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie&rsquo;s remark gave me an idea, and I formed a little
plan, of which you shall hear the result.</p>
<p>The next morning&mdash;St. Valentine&rsquo;s morning&mdash;as the
children were at breakfast in the nursery, a scratching was
heard at the door; and when it was opened, there appeared
in the doorway&mdash;what do you suppose now? There was a
little doggie, the very likeness of Tip, standing on his hind
legs, with a valentine in his mouth. The valentine was
addressed to Annie: and when I followed the little terrier
into the room, and told her that not only the valentine, but
the doggie too was for her&mdash;that I gave it to her to be her
very own, she was more delighted than I can describe to
you.</p>
<p>When I formed this little plan the day before, I had just
remembered where a doggie, very like Tip, was for sale.
I had bought him that very afternoon, and managed the
surprise as you see. Annie very soon grew as fond of
Charlie&mdash;that was the name of the little dog&mdash;as she had
ever been of Tip.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-041dt.jpg" alt="T" width="101" height="117" />
</div>
<p>This is a picture of a bird called the
Sparrow-hawk. It is rather a small
kind of hawk, and contents itself
with swooping down upon poor little
unoffending sparrows, and such small
game. Like other birds of prey, it is
becoming more scarce every year in
England, and being a very wild shy
bird, it does not come near people or houses if it can help
it. Still, when it is very hungry, or has little hungry bird-children
at home in its nest, it becomes very brave and
fierce, as you will see by the story I am going to tell you
of what happened to me when I was a little girl.</p>
<p>It was, I remember, a very cold morning, and the trees
were standing bleak and bare against the sky; the world
looked dreary enough, and there were heavy clouds hanging
over all. I had come out into the garden to bowl
my hoop, when old Tidyman, the gardener, who was
sweeping the snow from the paths, and who dearly loved
a little chat, said to me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be having a fine fall, missie, presently: it&rsquo;s
rare and cold surely. The birds is a&rsquo;most starving: there
be a sparrer-hawk a&rsquo;hoverin over here as seems precious
hungry. It have a nesty, I know, in that there holler tree
in the park, and as soon as ever them pore little birds
you see there trying to peck a bit, comes together, that
there sparrer-hawk he comes after them. Looky there!&rdquo;
exclaimed the old man, pointing to a hawk high in the
air above our heads, &ldquo;if he ain&rsquo;t a&rsquo;hoverin over us now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor little dickies, who were pecking away at a
few crumbs, which had been thrown out to them in the
garden by some kind-hearted maid belonging to the
house, seemed suddenly to become conscious of their
danger, and flew off with a frightened twittering cry.
One only&mdash;a very young and very foolhardy little sparrow&mdash;remained
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
to take a last peck. The hawk singled out
this poor birdie for his prey, and allowing the others to
fly away in peace, suddenly swooped down upon the little
laggard, fastening his cruel beak in its poor quivering
body.</p>
<p>This took place within half-a-dozen yards of the spot
where old Tidyman and I stood talking. I was but a child
of seven years old, but I hated cruelty, and always longed
to help the weak against the strong; so I rushed at the
hawk, hoopstick in hand. The little sparrow was already
dead; but what do you think the savage hawk did? It
turned upon me, and flew at my face. I put my hand up
just in time, and had a piece pecked out of one of my
fingers instead.</p>
<p>When Tidyman came up, the horrid bird flew off, not
forgetting, though, to pick up and carry off the little dead
sparrow in triumph. I have no doubt the baby-hawks, in
their nest in the hollow tree, greeted him with open
mouths, as you see them in the picture, and they were fed
not only with the little dead sparrow, but also with a nice
piece out of my poor little finger.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">A SPOILT CHILD.&mdash;JEANNE.&mdash;MAURICE MAKES COMPARISONS.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-043da.jpg" alt="A" width="79" height="137" />
</div>
<p>A Sister of Mr. de Roisel was married to
a gentleman named Hector de Malassise,
and they had an only child, a son, of
about the same age as Maurice. They
lived in the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau,
where Mr. de Malassise had an
estate. The two families, living so far
apart, were accustomed to pay long visits,
which generally lasted some weeks, at
each others&rsquo; houses.</p>
<p>Soon after Fritz had made a present of the wooden horse
to Maurice, it was arranged that the family of de Roisel
should pay a visit to their relations at Malassise. Now
Maurice, to tell the truth, did not look forward with
pleasure to this visit; for Eus&egrave;be&mdash;that was the name of
his cousin&mdash;had a very bad temper, and my little friend
found it very difficult to get on with him. This boy was
thoroughly spoiled, and made everyone about him miserable
by his caprices and his tyranny. His papa and mamma
did not dare to punish, or even to scold him, for they had
got an idea into their heads that, if he was thwarted or
contradicted, it might bring on a nervous illness.</p>
<p>A country doctor being one day at the house of Mr. de
Malassise, when Eus&egrave;be was teasing his father to give him
something he ought not to have, had carelessly said,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
pray let him have it, or he&rsquo;ll worry himself into a
nervous fever.&rdquo; The doctor afterwards in vain assured the
parents that he had not made the remark at all seriously;
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
he could not remove the impression his words had produced.
The parental hearts had taken alarm, and from that day the
father and mother were always in fear lest their dear boy
should be put out, or anything should make him angry.
His wishes became laws for the whole household: at his
slightest frown every one about him trembled, as it is said
the gods on Mount Olympus trembled at the frown of
Jupiter;&mdash;and he was a pagan deity who, I assure you,
was not wanting in caprices.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img id="xxx3" src="images/i-044.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="359" />
<p class="pcap">A GOAT-CHAISE IN THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES.</p>
</div>
<p>While his papa and mamma were waiting in trembling
anxiety for this attack of nerves, which never came, Eus&egrave;be,
in spite of his bad temper, enjoyed excellent health; and
ate, drank, and slept, as well as possible. They were in
fact the only things he did do well.</p>
<p>Eus&egrave;be always had beautiful toys, and he delighted in
showing them to Maurice with an air of superiority that
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
was humiliating to his little cousin, whose toys were common
and cheap. It was only natural that the latter should have
some wish to retaliate, and hearing that they were going to
Malassise, he thought what a pleasure it would be to take
Cressida with him. Eus&egrave;be could not have a toy-horse
like that. Mr. de Roisel, however, put a stop to this project;
because, as he said, if Eus&egrave;be should take a fancy to
the horse, Maurice would be expected to give it up to him;
and that would not do at all. Maurice saw that his papa
was right.</p>
<p>I need hardly say that Eus&egrave;be always got tired of his
toys very soon, and every time Maurice went to stay
with him there was a new collection to be seen. On the
occasion of this visit, Maurice found that Eus&egrave;be&rsquo;s favourite
plaything for the moment was a goat. Not a goat of wood
or pasteboard, such as you children have all possessed
perhaps, but a real live one; as much alive as those you
may see any day harnessed in goat-chaises in the Champs-Elys&eacute;es
at Paris; only she was prettier than any I have
seen there.</p>
<p>The goat was called Jeanne, as I daresay some of my
little readers are called, but they need not be ashamed of
their namesake. She was a well-behaved, graceful creature,
and her long silky coat, which was perfectly white, shone
in the sunshine like silver. She had no horns, it is true,
but this was scarcely to be regretted, for the most gentle
animals are apt sometimes to use their horns against their
friends. So Eus&egrave;be had nothing to fear on this account.
She wore round her neck a red collar, on which her name
was embroidered in letters of gold. Eus&egrave;be would tie a
string through this collar, and lead her three or four times
a day into a meadow near the house, where she nibbled
the grass and flowers.</p>
<p>I cannot describe to you the delight with which Maurice
watched Jeanne jumping about, or playing with her two
little kids; and all with an ease such as nature alone can
give. He could not help making a comparison between
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
her and Cressida. Then he looked into her soft dark eyes,
which appeared to express thoughts: Cressida had fine
dark eyes too, but somehow they were not the same thing.
Jeanne liked to climb on to high banks, and would stand
sometimes on the edge of a precipice, stretching out her
neck to eat the leaves of some tree: Cressida was strong
upon the legs too, and its knees had never been marked
by a fall; still it could not have done so much. Out in
the fields Jeanne seemed to listen to distant noises, which
you scarcely heard; her little ears kept moving about in
all directions as if to let no sound escape her: Cressida
had also pretty little ears, but somehow the wooden horse
never seemed to listen as Jeanne did.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img id="xxx4" src="images/i-046.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="364" />
<p class="pcap">SOON SHE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH MAURICE, AND LET HIM CARESS HER.</p>
</div>
<p>Very soon Jeanne became familiar with Maurice, and let
him caress her; while, by way of thanking him, she would
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
lick his hands: Cressida had never made such advances
as this to its young master. Yet another advantage had
Jeanne over the horse: when she had been running, her
sides moved up and down; you could see that a heart was
beating in her breast: but Cressida&rsquo;s sides, beautiful and
glossy as they were, never heaved after a gallop. Maurice
was making these comparisons during a whole day, and in
the evening was so occupied with his reflections, that
instead of playing at dominoes with Eus&egrave;be, he sat silent
by the side of his mamma.</p>
<p>The next morning he talked a great deal in praise of
Cressida, but did not cease to caress and play with Jeanne.
While he was stroking her, Eus&egrave;be suddenly said to him:&mdash;&ldquo;I
am beginning to get tired of Jeanne; if you like,
we&rsquo;ll make an exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall give me Cressida; I should like to make his
acquaintance very much; and then in exchange I&rsquo;ll give
you this goat, that you think so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot give you Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t give me Cressida! why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can never part with Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; rejoined Eus&egrave;be, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t think
Jeanne is worth so much as the horse. Then the fact is
that you don&rsquo;t think her so pretty after all; and you&rsquo;ve
been telling lies in calling her pretty all this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telling lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have. She&rsquo;s ugly in reality; she is; I think
she&rsquo;s frightful now. Oh, you ugly beast, I&rsquo;ll kill you!
There, there, there&rsquo;s something for you to punish you for
being so ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he gave the poor goat several cuts on the head
with a whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eus&egrave;be,&rdquo; cried my little friend, &ldquo;how can you be so
cruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice saw the tears trickling from the eyes of Jeanne,
and pointed them out to Eus&egrave;be, who only shrugged his
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
shoulders. He was not in the least ashamed of himself,
and added,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like me to hit her, give me your famous
horse in exchange; that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot, because I&rsquo;ve promised not to part with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve made a promise, have you? What does
that matter? Why, I make promises every evening, and
break them every morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; exclaimed Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, every evening mamma says to me,
&lsquo;My pretty Eus&egrave;be, my little treasure, promise me now
that you won&rsquo;t put yourself into passions, nor disobey me
any more; promise me that, dear, and here are some bonbons
for you, and some chocolate <i>&agrave; la cr&egrave;me</i>.&rsquo; I promise
of course, naturally. Afterwards, in the morning, when I
want some more, she refuses, because, she says, I ought
not to eat them before breakfast; but I put myself into such
a terrible passion that she gives me them directly. That&rsquo;s
how it is, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very wrong to behave in that way,&rdquo; said
Maurice: &ldquo;but after all, your promises are not made quite
seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are yours, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine are serious promises, and I keep them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s just because you&rsquo;ve heard that men keep
their promises,&rdquo; replied Eus&egrave;be, &ldquo;and you want to be like
a man. But the truth is, men are like me, I can tell you:
they make promises to get what they want, and then they
break them again to get what they want. It&rsquo;s all very fine
for them to say to us children&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell lies, be always
just, keep your promises!&rsquo; Oh, I&rsquo;m not to be taken in; I
know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, my little readers, I do not say to you that the
world is peopled with only honest men: that would be
deceiving you. But be assured that those who tell falsehoods
are everywhere despised; and when anyone speaks
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
of them, or writes about them, it is in order to show how
much they ought to be hated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Eus&egrave;be, &ldquo;you make a fine mistake when
you think you are obliged to keep the horse because you
made a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your opinion, but I know the contrary,&rdquo; said
Maurice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk any more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t have Jeanne, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the vintage began in the vineyards of Mr.
de Malassise. Eus&egrave;be was so much amused with all the
bustle, and the coming and going of so many grape-pickers,
that he had no time to think of Jeanne. This
lasted three or four days, and the poor beast began to
think she was free from her tormentor altogether: but no
such luck for her! After that time, Eus&egrave;be, already tired
of the vintage, and particularly of the grape-pickers, who
would not let him beat them, came back to make a victim
of her. Maurice reasoned with him, and tried in vain to
soften him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&ldquo; said Eus&egrave;be, &ldquo;if you pity her so much,
take her and give me your horse. Unless you do, she
belongs to me, and I can do what I like with her&mdash;sell her,
beat her, or kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your papa wouldn&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t he indeed! He&rsquo;d be nicely punished if he
interfered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d have a nervous attack directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice was very unhappy. Do what he would to persuade
himself to the contrary, he recognised the superiority
of Jeanne over Cressida. He would willingly have made the
exchange, but that he remembered the solemn way in which
Fritz asked him to promise that he would never part with
the little horse; and child though he was, he knew he was
bound to keep his promise. Still, a struggle was going on
in his own mind. He felt drawn towards Jeanne, as it is
said little birds are sometimes fascinated and attracted by
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
the gaze of certain snakes. At last he adopted a bold
resolution: he went to his father, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear papa, I want to go away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;What
has happened? Have you quarrelled with Eus&egrave;be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; rejoined Maurice, &ldquo;I generally give way
to him; but now he wants me to give him Cressida in
exchange for Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Jeanne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful white goat, who has two pretty little
kids; and Eus&egrave;be beats her because he wants me to take
her and give him Cressida; but Fritz told me never to part
with the wooden horse. You see, papa, Jeanne is not
made of wood; she lives and feels like me, and it&rsquo;s
terrible to see lately how he beats her. You can&rsquo;t imagine
how nice she is; and so grateful to any one who is kind to
her. Then to see how she loves her little children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, if that&rsquo;s the case we must not leave her
with Eus&egrave;be any longer. Tell him I&rsquo;ll make him&mdash;a
present of something much more valuable in exchange for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I know he won&rsquo;t give her for anything but
Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he must be a little monster. Don&rsquo;t be unhappy,
my child: tomorrow morning we will leave Malassise, so
you shall see no more of his cruelty, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more at home, Maurice did not long remain unhappy
about Jeanne. Do not accuse him of caprice, my little
readers; but think how quickly your own impressions pass
away or change. It is natural to childhood that it should
be so.</p>

<h2 id="c18">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3>STEPHEN.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-054di.jpg" alt="I" width="43" height="71" />
</div>
<p>I was staying down in Kent with some friends of
mine, when I made the acquaintance of the
little boy whom you see lying on the ground in
the picture.</p>
<p>One early spring morning, towards the end of
February, I went out for a constitutional&mdash;that is,
as I daresay you know, a walk for the sake of one&rsquo;s health.
I wandered off down the park into a little wood, or shrubbery,
which had a green path winding through it, with
arbours or summer-houses placed here and there under the
overhanging trees. The wind was very keen, and patches
of snow were still upon the ground, though the days were
beginning to lengthen, and there were many signs of
warmer weather at hand. As I walked along, I noticed
now and then a young leaf showing itself above the ground,
which told me of the coming primroses; and I could see
green shoots, from which bluebells would soon be springing
to nod their graceful heads to the passers by.</p>
<p>Walking along briskly, I had nearly reached one of the
little arbours, when I observed several children standing
in front of it. I knew them well by sight and name: they
were the children of the lodge-keeper of the park, and
lived close by. There were four of them, and they were
all standing staring away, as hard as their eight young
eyes could stare, at something inside the arbour. Reaching
the spot, I discovered that the object of their curiosity
was a poor little lad of about ten years of age, who was
lying on the ground with his eyes closed, and his head
resting against the seat. He was a fair, curly-headed,
pretty boy, but his clothes were very poor and ragged,
and his little face was pinched and wan. I soon discovered
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
that he was not asleep, but either benumbed by the cold,
or insensible from exhaustion.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-055.jpg" alt="Child and dog" width="500" height="782" />
</div>
<p>A little black and tan terrier, of no great value or
beauty, was sitting by his side, seeming to watch him with
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
great anxiety; and I was surprised to see also some toys
lying on the ground, but these I found belonged to the
lodge-keeper&rsquo;s children, who had left them in the arbour
the day before, and had in fact come that morning to fetch
them.</p>
<p>I sent off one of the children to their father to come and
carry the boy to the house. The family were just collecting
at the breakfast table when I returned from my early
walk, bringing this poor little waif in with me. My friends
took an interest in him at once, and after he had been well
warmed and fed, he recovered sufficiently to tell us his
story.</p>
<p>He was a London boy, and had lived there with his
mother, who earned a scanty subsistence for them both by
needlework. At her death, two or three weeks before, he
was left alone in the world. Then he heard the neighbours
talk of the workhouse; and having a vague dread of being
sent there, he had resolved to go right away into the
country. His only companion was this little terrier, which
had attached itself to him in the odd way in which stray
dogs will sometimes adopt a master. Begging now and
then for food at farmhouses and cottage doors, and sleeping
at night in sheds or outhouses, he had managed in
three days to come about thirty miles from London; but
he would have died from exhaustion or cold if I had not
found him that morning.</p>
<p>This happened about two years ago, and I call him one of
&ldquo;my little friends,&rdquo; because I still take the greatest interest
in him. The family with whom I was then staying have
looked after him ever since. He was sent to lodge at the
cottage of a labourer, and goes to the village school,
where he is such a good boy and so quick at his lessons,
that I have no doubt he will get on well in the world.</p>

<h2 id="c20">AUNT TOTTY&rsquo;S PETS:</h2>
<h3>MOKO.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-058da.jpg" alt="A" width="80" height="112" />
</div>
<p>Aunt Totty is an old maid&mdash;I need not say
how old,&mdash;and very fond of birds and
animals, which she professes to think are
sometimes very superior to men. At her
own home, which is at Paris, she has
quite a collection of pets. She often
comes to England, however, to visit her
relations, and then her little nephews and nieces&mdash;for she
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
likes children too&mdash;always get round her, and make her
tell them stories about her animals or birds. One evening,
when the children were gathered round her, she began in
this way:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to hear about my pets, my dears? Very
well: I shall have pleasure in telling you all about them;
for although I have had some bites and scratches and
pecks from them now and then, on the whole they are very
estimable. In fact, they possess some qualities which I
should be very glad to see oftener than I do in men and
women: yes, and in little children too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first pet animal I can remember was a monkey. I
was then quite little, not more than five or six years old;
and Moko&mdash;that was the monkey&rsquo;s name&mdash;was almost as
big as I was. I really think he considered that he and I
were of the same species: at all events he used to treat
me as a companion and an equal. But before Moko
joined our family circle, we were very near having another
monkey, who was not so amiable; and I think I will begin
by telling you about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In those days&mdash;that is, when your mamma and I and
your two uncles were all children&mdash;you know that we used
generally to live in France, and one summer your grandpapa
took a country house a few miles out of Paris. Well,
on a beautiful warm morning, when we children were all
playing in the large garden, we heard the sound of an
organ; and soon we saw, coming through the white gates
and playing as he came, an organ-man, with a monkey
sitting on the organ. A shout of delight resounded
through the garden. When the new-comers approached
we were even more delighted, for the monkey was dressed
up in the funniest way possible. He looked like a tiny old
man, with a cocked hat, long red coat, blue breeches, and
a little pair of boots upon his feet, laced up with red laces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-060.jpg" alt="Monkey on banister" width="500" height="811" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The monkey performed all manner of tricks: he danced,
he fired off a little musket, went through the sword exercise,
put on spectacles and pretended to read the newspaper,
and did a great deal more besides. After witnessing these
wonderful performances, we conducted both monkey and
man into the drawing-room, where our mamma was sitting
at the open window, and we all began in chorus:&mdash;&lsquo;Oh,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
mamma dear, pray, <i>pray</i> buy this monkey for us; he is
such a darling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we were all, as children, very fond of animals,&mdash;though
I am the only one, I think, who has the same liking
still&mdash;and our mamma used rather to encourage us in it.
In fact, we had almost a menagerie already, and this was
not the first time we had teazed mamma to let us have a
monkey. She seemed inclined to give way, and asked the
organ-man if he would sell it. He hesitated: apparently
a little struggle was going on in his own conscience, but
his honesty prevailed, and he confessed that, except in his
presence, and under his control, the monkey was both mischievous
and savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time the creature stood in front of a large
looking-glass, bowing and scraping to his own reflection;
and mamma appearing to doubt this bad character of the
seemingly amiable monkey, the man at last said:&mdash;&lsquo;Let me
leave him, madam, for a moment, and you shall judge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man immediately hid himself behind a sofa. When
the monkey looked round, and no longer saw his master,
the very expression of his withered, wrinkled little face
began to change,&mdash;from an expression of good-temper it
changed to one of fury. He at once jumped upon the
mantelpiece, and before anyone had time to prevent it, he
dashed the clock against the looking-glass, smashing both.
My mother seizing him to prevent more mischief, he
scratched and bit her cruelly, till he heard his master&rsquo;s
voice, and saw his stern face and uplifted arm. Then in
a second he became the amiable tractable creature he had
been before; but you may be sure we were glad to get rid
of the horrid little animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we still wanted a monkey; and great was our
joy when papa brought us Moko. He bought him of a
sailor, who declared he was as gentle and obedient as
any dog, and had been the pet of the whole crew of the
ship he had come over in. And I must say Moko was as
nearly perfect as anyone I know, for he had but one fault:
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
he was very greedy. I remember one day a box full of
fine pears had been left in the hall near the foot of the
staircase, and we found Moko hanging by his tail to the
balusters, and helping himself to the pears. He was eating
them in that uncomfortable position: his cheek stuck
out from the quantity he had stuffed into his mouth; and
we found afterwards that he had besides stowed away a
good many under the staircase as a future provision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a painful recollection of Moko stealing bread
and jam away from me. He used to come behind me
quite quietly when I was sitting at the table at breakfast
or tea, and climbing on to the back of my little chair, he
would stretch his long hairy arm over my shoulder, and
snatch the bread and jam away before I knew he was
there. He always selected me to attack, I suppose because
I was the smallest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of this fault, we all loved Moko very much.
He was petted by the whole household. He used to join
us children in our games, and always appeared to take
pains not to hurt us. He was allowed to play about the
garden just as he pleased, for he would always come back
when he was called; and it was pretty to see him climbing
from tree to tree, or hanging on to a branch by his tail,
and swinging backwards and forwards.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c22">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>THE NOBLEMAN&rsquo;S SON HEALED.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-064di.jpg" alt="I" width="78" height="112" />
</div>
<p>I have already told you, my little ones,
how our Lord Jesus Christ turned the
water into wine at the marriage feast.
That was His first miracle, and one of
the few He performed which were not
works of healing; for He went about curing
the sick, and in some instances restoring
to life those who were already dead.</p>
<p>We are told in the Bible that after this first miracle, our
Saviour left Cana and went to Jerusalem to keep the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
Passover, and it is stated that while there He performed
several miracles in the way of healing, which were so
wonderful that His fame spread throughout the land.
After the Passover, Christ left Jerusalem, and turned His
steps towards Galilee.</p>
<p>Now in a city of Galilee, called Capernaum, there lived
a nobleman, who had an only child, a son, that he loved
with his whole heart. The child was very ill&mdash;so ill that
there was no hope of recovery. The little face that the
poor father loved so much grew pale and wan, and the
pretty bright eyes lost their brightness. Everything that
human skill could do had been tried in vain; but the father
had heard of the miracles done by Jesus in Jerusalem, and
knowing that He was then passing through that part of the
country, he left the bedside of his dying child, and came
himself to Christ.</p>
<p>St. John tells us&mdash;&ldquo;He besought Christ that He would
come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of
death. Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs
and wonders ye will not believe. The nobleman saith unto
Him, Sir, come down ere my child die. Jesus saith unto
him, Go thy way: thy son liveth. And the man believed
the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this account it appears as if the nobleman went to
our Saviour only as a last resource, and scarcely believing
in His power. This was why Christ said as a sort of reproof,
&ldquo;Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.&rdquo;
Then the poor father prayed again to Him to <i>come</i> to his
son, thinking that to save the boy our Saviour must see
and touch him. But Christ showed him that He could heal
the boy as well at a distance as near, and said, &ldquo;Go thy
way: thy son liveth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man&rsquo;s faith, you see, had grown suddenly, and
became perfect; for he believed without hesitation our
Saviour&rsquo;s word, and returned home at once. He did not
stay to question, but he went home, taking it for granted
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
that he would find the miracle performed, and that his son
was living as Jesus had declared, although this was the first
instance in which Christ had healed at a distance.</p>
<p>He believed so firmly that all would be well when he got
home, that he does not appear even to have hurried on his
journey; and he met some of his servants the next day
before he reached his house. The servants had come out
to meet him, and they were the bearers of the happy
tidings of his son&rsquo;s recovery. Then he anxiously inquired
when the child began to get better, and they told him:
&ldquo;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&rdquo; And
the father knew it was at that hour Christ had said to him,
&ldquo;Thy son liveth.&rdquo; From that time, St. John tells us the
nobleman and all his household were believers.</p>
<p>We learn, my dear children, from this miracle that sorrow
and trouble often lead to good. They brought the anxious
and sorrowing father to Christ, and caused not only the father
but all the household to become believers. Let us trust and
pray that through such suffering and such trials as may be
in store for us we too may be brought nearer to God.</p>

<h2 id="c23">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3>JACK AND JERRY.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-068df.jpg" alt="F" width="78" height="114" />
</div>
<p>From the heading of this page you would
scarcely know which I call my little friend&mdash;Jack
the boy, or Jerry the donkey.
Friends of mine indeed they both are;
but I think I am fond of Jerry chiefly on
account of the love he bears his little
master.</p>
<p>Jack is the oldest of a large family of
boys and girls; he is only ten years of age, but there are
six other children, all younger than he is. On his fifth
birthday he had a rocking-horse given him: it came down
from London, for Jack&rsquo;s home is far away in the country.
How delighted the little boy was when the horse stood
in the hall, covered up with thick brown paper! He knew
it was addressed to him, for he could already read writing
when it was large. Then, as the brown paper was taken
off, what a jumping and shouting there was: for the other
little ones had come down from the nursery to see the
gee-gee.</p>
<p>You all know what a large handsome rocking-horse is
like, so I need not describe it; and you can imagine what
a deal of amusement and pleasure it afforded Jack for a
while. However, as time went on, fresh little brothers
and sisters arrived quickly; and each in turn, as he or
she grew old enough, began to take delight in the gee-gee;
until at last my friend Jack scarcely ever had the
chance of a ride. And I must say the poor horse looked
old and battered, and very different from what it had
looked when only used by my little friend.</p>
<p>One day he said to me sadly:&mdash;&ldquo;You see I am getting
big for it now, and there are so many of the little ones to
ride, so I give it up: the poor gee-gee is worked hard
enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Jack was always willing to let the children ride his horse,
but, worn and damaged though it was, he could not bear
to see them ill-use it. I have noticed the child wince as if
with pain, when his sturdy brother Maurice made a great
piece of paint drop off with a heavy crack from his whip.
&ldquo;If the boy is so sensitive about a rocking-horse,&rdquo; thought
I, &ldquo;how careful and kind he would be, if he had a real
pony or donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I proposed to give Jack a pony, his mamma said
she thought he was not old enough to ride one yet, and
seemed nervous about it, so I made up my mind that a
donkey it should be. I made inquiries, and soon found a
dear little creature, which I thought so pretty that I
bought it at once. It was very young, and had never
before left its mother. Jack named it Jerry: he took such
care of it, and made such a pet of the little animal, that it
would come at his call, and follow him about, and obey
him, just like a large dog.</p>
<p>I remember one day, when we were all sitting at lunch,
we heard, patter, patter, patter on the floorcloth of the
hall. Presently the door, which was not closed, opened a
little way. A soft mouse-coloured nose presented itself,
followed by a rough hairy face, with a pair of soft full
bright eyes, and after these came two long ears; then the
whole of Master Jerry&rsquo;s head looked round the corner at
us. We all burst out laughing, as you may easily suppose;
when the donkey, thinking to join in the merriment,
put up his head, and raised such a &ldquo;Heehaw! heehaw!&rdquo;
that we were obliged to clap our hands over our ears, and
the whole house, I may almost say the neighbourhood,
rang with the sound.</p>
<p>As soon as Jerry was big and strong enough to be
ridden, I made Jack a present of a bridle and saddle. He
used to ride about in the park and lanes; but when they
came home, Jack never forgot to give Jerry a few fresh
carrots, or something nice, as you see him doing in the
picture.</p>

<h2 id="c24">SQUIRRELS.</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-073dh.jpg" alt="H" width="97" height="118" />
</div>
<p>How pretty little squirrels look perched
in the branches of a tree! I like to
watch them as they nimbly run up the
trunk, or spring from bough to bough.
One or two are generally to be seen in
a clump of great old beeches near a
house in the country, where I usually
spend some happy weeks in summer;
and I will tell you a story of a little squirrel whose acquaintance
I made there last summer.</p>
<p>I happened to be up very early one morning, long before
breakfast was ready, or any of the family were down, and
I went out into the garden to enjoy the fresh sweet smell
of the early day. The cows were grazing in the field
beyond, and now and then lowing a friendly &ldquo;good-morning&rdquo;
to each other. Some ducks were waddling
in procession down to the pond, quacking out their wise
remarks as they went. The little birds were singing
lustily their welcome to the new-born day. Even the
old watch-dog came yawning, stretching, blinking, and
wagging his tail in kindly dog-fashion, to bid me &ldquo;good-day&rdquo;
in the summer sunshine.</p>
<p>As I stood under the great beech trees, taking in with
greedy eye and ear the sights and sounds of country life
so refreshing to a Londoner, I heard something fall from
one of the trees, then a scuffle, and immediately afterwards
a white Persian cat, belonging to the house, bounded
towards me in hot pursuit of a dear little squirrel. I was
just in time to save the poor little animal by stepping
between it and the cat. The squirrel passed under the
edge of my dress, and made off again up another tree; so
pussy lost her prey.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, when we were at breakfast, the butler
told us that one of the little boys of the village, who had
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
lost a pet squirrel, had asked if he might look for it in the
garden of the house. It had first escaped into some trees
in the park, and he had traced it from them into the
garden. It at once occurred to me that this must be the
little creature I had saved from the cat. I remembered
how it made straight towards me, as if asking me for protection
from its enemy, which only a tame squirrel would
do; and I proposed, when breakfast was over, that we
should go out and help in the search.</p>
<p>Little Jack Tompkins stood under the beech trees, looking
with tear-stained face up into the branches. Suddenly
I saw his face brighten, and he called out: &ldquo;I see un,
ma&rsquo;am; I see un! If so be no one warn&rsquo;t by, I be sure
he&rsquo;d come to I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need not say we retreated to a distance; then Jack
called up the tree in a loud whisper: &ldquo;Billee, Billee!&rdquo;
and in a minute down came the little creature on to his
shoulder. I can tell you Jack was a happier child than he
had been when he came into the garden. And when I
told him what a narrow escape &ldquo;Billee&rdquo; had had from the
cat, he said: &ldquo;It would be hard if a cat eat he, for our old
puss brought he up with her own kits.&rdquo; Then he told us
how the squirrel, when a tiny thing, had dropped out of its
nest, and been found by him lying almost dead at the foot
of a tree, and how he had carried it home, and tried
whether pussy would adopt it as one of her own kittens.
The cat was kind; the squirrel throve under her motherly
care, and became Jack&rsquo;s pet and companion.</p>
<p>Now, children, in this instance it was all very well to
keep a tame squirrel. &ldquo;Billee&rdquo; seemed happy, leading
the life he was accustomed to: he had been fed and cared
for by human beings from his infancy, and might be as
incapable of finding food, and managing for himself, in a
wild state, as a poor canary would be if let loose from its
cage. But generally it is cruel to imprison little wild
birds and animals who have known the enjoyment of
liberty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Squirrels are interesting little creatures. Besides being
so pretty, bright-eyed, and active, they are remarkably
intelligent. They make their nests in trees as birds do,
but with even more ingenuity than most birds. The
materials of the nest are moss, leaves, grass, and fibres of
the bark of trees, all neatly woven together. The nest is
waterproof, and secure from the roughest gale of wind; it
is, besides, carefully hidden from the view of any passer-by
beneath. The food of squirrels consists of vegetables,
nuts, acorns, and other fruits and seeds. These little
animals have the forethought to lay up provisions for the
winter; and not only do they keep a little store in their
nests, but in any hole they may chance to find in the surrounding
trees. Sometimes they have a dozen secret
storehouses within a few leaps of their nest.</p>

<p class="t0">To his cottage out of town;</p>

<p class="t0">And worked in it with all his might.</p>

<p class="t0">On kitchen-gardening. So you</p>
<p class="t0">May well suppose he heard with glee</p>

<p class="t0">A pumpkin shall be such a size</p>
<p class="t0">It will be sure to gain the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">In hothouse, where the heat was greater</p>
<p class="t0">Almost than in Mount Etna&rsquo;s crater,</p>
<p class="t0">The pumpkin grew, and grew so fine</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">JOURNEY TO PARIS.&mdash;CRESSIDA IN THE GARDEN OF THE LUXEMBOURG.&mdash;MAURICE&rsquo;S UNCLE.&mdash;A GREAT TEMPTATION.&mdash;MAURICE KEEPS HIS WORD.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-079dm.jpg" alt="M" width="80" height="112" />
</div>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. de Roisel were accustomed to
spend the winter in Paris; and when
November came on, and the time for their
departure arrived, it was not without
anxiety that Maurice thought of taking
Cressida to live on the first floor of a Paris
house. The rooms were large and handsome,
it is true, but not suitable for a horse: it was necessary,
however, to make the best of circumstances.</p>
<p>They drove to the railway station at Savigny, where Mr.
de Roisel arranged for them to have a carriage to themselves,
and Cressida was lifted into it, for Maurice wanted
to make the journey to Paris mounted, on the back of his
horse. Off they started: my little friend, firmly seated on
his saddle, went along at the rate of forty miles an hour.
In less than an hour, however, they reached Paris, and then
Maurice confessed that he felt tired: it was the first time
he had made so long a journey on horseback.</p>
<p>Arrived at their own house, Maurice at once set about
making the pony as comfortable as he could. The first
night Cressida had to rough it a little; but in the course
of two or three days Maurice had fitted up in his own bedroom
a stable, which corresponded with the general comfort
and elegance of the rooms occupied by the family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>

<p class="pcap">THE WORKMAN, AFTER HIS DAY&rsquo;S TOIL IS OVER, WALKS THERE WITH HIS CHILDREN.</p>
</div>
<p>Picture to yourselves a white tent embroidered in blue,
supported against the wall of the room. The entrance to
it is shut up by curtains; but when open, these curtains
are held back on each side by broad blue ribbons. Inside
the tent, at the end against the wall of the room, are a rack
and a manger of ebony. At one side stands a large chest,
also of ebony: it is divided into two compartments&mdash;one
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
for corn, the other containing everything required for
grooming a horse. Also at the end of the tent, hanging
against the wall, are a saddle and bridle of Russia leather,
and two or three whips. I must add that a beautiful sheepskin
rug, white and soft as the down of a swan, takes the
place of the straw put down for litter in a common stable.
Such was the new abode of the pretty pony.</p>
<p>When it became known that Maurice possessed a wonderful
horse, which, though made of wood, could gallop,
and neigh, and shake his head like a real horse, he received
numerous visits; and his little friends envied him his
happiness. Several of them proposed to him that he should
give them Cressida in exchange for some of their own
beautiful toys; such as, for instance, a mule with bells, like
the mules in Spain; a pretty sailing boat, intended to sail
on the basin in the Tuileries; a box containing everything
required for performing the astonishing tricks of the famous
conjuror Robert Houdin; a whole flock of sheep with
their shepherd; and one little girl offered him her most
beautiful doll&mdash;a doll that had the air of a queen, and
whose clothes were made of fine cambric and lace.</p>
<p>But what were the most beautiful toys in the world compared
to Cressida? Maurice, who had so bravely resisted
the temptation of giving his horse in exchange for Jeanne,
found no difficulty in refusing these offers.</p>
<p>For some days after Maurice arrived in Paris, the
weather continued mild and fine, although it was so late
in the autumn; and he was able to go out several times
with Cressida into the gardens of the Luxembourg. These
gardens may not be particularly fashionable, but they are
very beautiful all the same. You may see there elegantly
dressed ladies and gentlemen, and children with clean and
tidy nurses; but you also see there, in the evening, the
workman, after his day&rsquo;s toil is over, walking with his
children; perhaps carrying one in his arms: and though
he may carry it awkwardly, it is still touching to see what
care he takes of it.</p>

<p class="pcap">ONE OF THE KEEPERS OF THE GARDENS MAKES A MISTAKE.</p>
</div>
<p>My little friend, whose parents had no prejudice against
the gardens for reasons of this kind, went there often, and
delighted in riding up and down the great avenue upon
Cressida. They made a sensation together, I assure you.
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
Not only the children, but the mammas and even the
gentlemen expressed their surprise and admiration. Many
people thought at first that Cressida was a real pony. I
have been told, though I do not vouch for the fact, that
one of the keepers of the gardens, going up to Maurice,
summoned him to leave, because it was not permitted to
ride there on horseback. This caused great amusement,
as you may suppose, among the lookers-on. It has been
said also that this mistake of the keeper was reported in
the <i>Journal des Enfants</i>&mdash;(The Child&rsquo;s Journal)&mdash;a day or
two after it occurred, but I cannot say I recollect reading
it. Maurice used to take his horse into the Luxembourg
gardens every day that it was fine, and enjoyed his rides
very much.</p>
<p>Maurice had an uncle&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s brother&mdash;a lieutenant
in the navy, who returned about this time from a distant
expedition. He came to rest from his fatigues at Paris,
and took up his abode with his sister, of whom he was very
fond. He was a young man of about twenty-eight or
thirty years of age, intelligent, and of very agreeable
manners. But beneath this amiable and gentle surface,
he possessed a strong will, and a resolute devotion to
whatever he might consider to be a duty.</p>
<p>The uncle and nephew soon became great friends, and
were almost inseparable. They used to go out walking
together, and sometimes the uncle would teach Maurice
his lessons. In the evening they often went together to
the circus or to an exhibition of some sort. But when
they passed the evening at home, Maurice was almost
more amused; for he never tired of looking over books of
sketches, which his uncle had made during his voyages.</p>
<p>There were sketches representing the Red Indians of
America; the natives of Australia; the inhabitants of the
islands in the Southern Pacific, and of the coasts of Africa.
Maurice was astonished to see faces painted in all the
colours of the rainbow; and he wondered at the singular
ideas savages have of making themselves look more beautiful.
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
He saw some with pieces of wood fixed into their
under lips, to make them hang down; some with their teeth
blackened; others with their eyelids painted red. There
were also sketches of Laplanders, who were certainly not
handsome,&mdash;not figures that a sculptor would choose for
models. Maurice&rsquo;s uncle gave him an account also of the
manners and customs of all these people, and my little
friend learnt with horror that among savages, there are
those who roast and devour their fellow-creatures with the
same relish with which we eat good roast beef and mutton.</p>
<p>Then his uncle showed him landscapes of strange
countries, all drawn by himself, and sketches of the principal
cities he had visited; afterwards, drawings of foreign
birds and flowers, such as are not to be found in Europe.
All this interested Maurice, and while it amused him, gave
him lessons in natural history and geography. You will
easily understand how fond he was likely to become of
such a kind companion and teacher.</p>
<p>The uncle always showed a great interest in Cressida,
admired its mechanism, and was fond of watching the little
horse and its rider as they went along together. One day,
when he had been looking at them for some time with a
very thoughtful air, he said suddenly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a horse like Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not buy one then?&rdquo; replied Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you know very well that is impossible. There is
no such horse to be had anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; rejoined Maurice; &ldquo;but why do you
want a wooden horse&mdash;you who are so big, and can ride
a real horse, if you wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No real horse&mdash;not the most beautiful in the world&mdash;could
be the same to me as Cressida,&rdquo; rejoined the uncle.
&ldquo;It may seem like a caprice, but it is not. I am going to
sea again very soon, and I confess I should like to take
Cressida with me. I could amuse myself with him on
board ship. He would be a great resource during the
long tedious hours when there is nothing to do. Besides,
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
if I had the horse I should feel myself less separated from
you all; and it would remind me of you particularly,
Maurice, whom I shall be so sorry to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear uncle, what you desire is impossible. I
cannot give you Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to give it me for nothing, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I wish I could give it you for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, now, to what I intend to do: I will leave you in
exchange all my books of sketches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray stop, uncle,&rdquo; cried Maurice, feeling more
and more unhappy; &ldquo;what you are saying makes me so
miserable. You know I promised Fritz never to part with
Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But every day people make promises which they do
not keep: besides, Fritz did not know that I should ever
wish to have the horse, when he asked you to make that
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, I gave my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the word of a child: what does that signify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does age make a difference? Are not children expected
to keep their promises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean to say exactly that,&rdquo; replied the
uncle. &ldquo;Your own conscience must teach you how that
ought to be. But I think it strange that you should prefer
that old Fritz to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now you must not suppose, my little readers, that
Maurice resisted his uncle&rsquo;s persuasion with the calm
steadfastness of a grown-up man, whose mind is quite clear
as to his duty, and who is quite decided to keep to it. No:
poor little Maurice found his heart drawing him one way
and his conscience another. At last he wisely determined
that he would take an opportunity, when alone with his
father, to ask his advice: but the young lieutenant did not
give him a chance of doing this, for he began again upon
the subject the same evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been reflecting,&rdquo; he said to Maurice, &ldquo;and I
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
think my books of sketches are not sufficient to give you
for your horse. Listen now: besides the books, I will give
you a real pony. Perhaps he will be rather bigger than
Cressida; but I will buy one as much like Cressida as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img id="xxx7" src="images/i-086.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="781" />
<p class="pcap">&ldquo;YOUR SON IS A HERO!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said Maurice, &ldquo;why not keep the live one
for yourself? You can even call it Cressida if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young officer was a little put out by this suggestion,
but after a minute he replied:&mdash;&ldquo;I could not take a real
horse with me on board ship; but a wooden horse is different.
Now look here: not only will I give you the pony,
but you shall have a groom expressly to take care of it;
and both groom and pony shall be kept at my expense
while I am away. I will pay, besides, for you to have
some lessons in riding, so that when your papa goes out
on horseback to the Bois de Boulogne you will be able to
ride by his side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, really, I will do all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, no! I cannot give you Cressida. If that poor
Fritz should ever come back, I will tell him all; and perhaps
he will let me give you the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You behave to me like a selfish and ungrateful child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, uncle, uncle,&rdquo; exclaimed poor little Maurice, and
he began to weep bitterly, &ldquo;is it possible that you say this
to me seriously? Ah, well! then you shall have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
was going to say,&mdash;&ldquo;you shall have Cressida;&rdquo; but
as he spoke his mother entered the room. Her presence
seemed to remind him that he was going to break his promise
after all; and he went on:&mdash;&ldquo;You may think what
you please, uncle, but I will not give you Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man with an appearance
of delight which astonished Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now go away from me, pray,&rdquo; said Maurice, still
crying bitterly. &ldquo;I am ill; I think I am going to faint:&rdquo;
and he ran into the arms of his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son is a hero!&rdquo; cried the young officer, joyfully,
addressing his sister. &ldquo;He is a hero, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;you are cruel,&rdquo; replied the mother, caressing
her son, who was sobbing convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you not hear,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;how he
kept to his word,&mdash;how he refused to give me Cressida?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not right,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;to torture a child by
such a trial. Suppose out of love for you he had given
way; you would have reproached him for listening to the
dictates of his heart rather than obeying his sense of duty.
Let me tell you that what is a virtue in grown-up people, is
not always so in a child. It is through their affections that
we govern children, and you would teach him to combat his
tenderest feelings. Besides, you set a bad example: you
were practising a deception in pretending that you wanted
the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! uncle,&rdquo; cried my little friend, who began to
recover, &ldquo;was it only make-believe when you asked me for
Cressida? You only wanted to see if I should keep my
promise? You would not have loved me any longer,
perhaps, if I had given it to you; and yet I should have
given it because I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that,&rdquo; said Mrs. de Roisel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a great man this little fellow will make some
day!&rdquo; exclaimed the uncle.</p>
<p>I daresay my little readers can see, though the uncle did
not, how near Maurice was to yielding and giving up Cressida
at last. We will allow the young officer to remain in
ignorance upon this point, but let us tell him that it is
always better to prevent faults than to provoke them.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-093.jpg" alt="A" width="274" height="518" />
</div>
<p>A hunter in the Tyrol, while engaged
in his dangerous employment, spied a
chamois with two little ones on the top
of a rock. The little chamois were
leaping and sporting by the side of
their mother, and she, while watching
their gambols, was on the alert to see
that no enemy came near to hurt them.
The hunter peeped over a rock at the happy
family, and determined, if possible, to take one of
the young ones alive. When the old chamois
caught sight of him, she was in a sad state of
alarm: she ran up to her little ones, and tried to
lead them on to leap from one rock to another; but
they were too young to leap far. In the meantime
the hunter was clambering nearer and nearer,
and would soon reach them.</p>
<p>Presently they came to a chasm, not very wide
across, but of immense depth. One of the little
chamois was big and strong enough to leap across
it, the other was not. At last the mother hit upon
a plan: she made her body into a bridge across the
chasm, placing her forefeet upon the further rock.
The young chamois, understanding her intention,
sprang upon her as lightly as a kitten, and reached
the other side; when they all scampered off. The
hunter did not dare to follow them over this
dreadful chasm, and they were soon safe beyond
the range of his gun.</p>

<h2 id="c32">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-096a.jpg" alt="I" width="264" height="544" />
</div>
<p>I must tell you to-day, my dear children,
about one of the miracles of our Saviour of
which I daresay you have already heard.
Perhaps, too, you have seen engravings of
the picture from which the woodcut above
is taken. It is a large painting by Raphael,
a great Italian artist of former days, whom
you will know more about when you are
older.</p>
<p>After our Saviour had healed the nobleman&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
son&mdash;the miracle I described to you in our last Sunday-talk&mdash;we
are told in the Bible that He left Cana and
went to Capernaum, a town on the shore of the lake, or
sea, of Galilee. The country surrounding this beautiful
lake is now desolate and barren; but at the time when
our Saviour lived upon earth, it was fertile and thickly
populated. On the banks of the lake were towns and
villages; on its waters boats plied, engaged in pleasure
or trade; and many fishermen carried on their calling.</p>
<p>One evening our Lord walked on the shore of the
lake, teaching His disciples, when He found Himself
surrounded by a multitude of people. They pressed about
Him, eager to hear Him preach; and in order to let
them hear and see Him better, He entered into one of
the fishing-boats which belonged to Simon Peter. And
Christ prayed Simon Peter to thrust out the boat a
little from the land: then He sat down, and taught the
people from the boat.</p>
<p>We are not told what was the particular purport of
His teaching on this occasion, but when He had done,
He resolved to render what He had said more impressive
by performing a miracle before the eyes of all
the people. He turned to Simon, and told him to
cast forth his nets to catch fish; upon which, St. Luke
tells us, Simon answered: &ldquo;Master, we have toiled all
the night and have taken nothing; nevertheless at thy
word I will let down the net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the language of obedience and faith. The
net was at once cast into the sea, and it enclosed such a
quantity of fish that it began to break. In the boat with
Christ, besides Simon Peter, was another fisherman, named
Andrew; and they beckoned to their partners, James and
John, the sons of Zebedee, who were in another boat, to
come to their assistance. Both boats were filled so full
of fish that they were almost sinking.</p>
<p>Scripture does not give us any account of the impression
this miraculous draught of fishes made upon the multitude
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
that were looking on from the shore; but the first thought
of Simon Peter seems to have been a sense of his own
unworthiness. Falling down at our Saviour&rsquo;s feet, he
cried: &ldquo;Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With mingled feelings of humility, gratitude, and awe, he
entreated Jesus to depart from one who was so guilty and undeserving.
But he did not know the love of Christ towards
him, or the gracious design of this miracle. His fears were
soon calmed. &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said Jesus to His trembling
disciple: &ldquo;from henceforth thou shalt catch men.&rdquo; From
that time Simon Peter, and his companions, Andrew, James,
and John, were to be employed in preaching the gospel.
These poor, ignorant fishermen became endowed with wisdom
and eloquence; and in the wonderful draught of fishes
they might foresee their future success. They were to
be &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo;; the world the sea in which they
were to labour.</p>
<p>St. Luke says of them: &ldquo;When they had brought their
ships to land, they forsook all and followed Him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c33">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3>RUBY.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-099dt.jpg" alt="T" width="76" height="138" />
</div>
<p>The little girl you see in the picture is one
of the very nicest of my little friends. She
looked just as you see her there on the day
of her party, which was given in honour of
her fourth birthday. I remember going
into the nursery while she was being
dressed. Nurse was just arranging her
sash, while she stood on a chair in front
of the looking-glass, admiring her little self
generally; but most admiring her pretty
blue shoes, which just matched her sash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>When she saw me at the door, she cried out: &ldquo;I ready
now; wait for me.&rdquo; And jumping off the chair and seizing
my hand, she tripped away downstairs, chattering
merrily as she went. The time of the year was the end of
April, and Ruby&rsquo;s home being in the country, and the
weather very fine and warm, some of the festivities took
place out of doors in the garden. There were dances, and
all sorts of games, on the dry sunny lawn, a soft westerly
wind blowing on the happy children the while, bringing
health and enjoyment with its sweet balmy breath.</p>
<p>While their fun was at its height, a curious figure
appeared upon the lawn. It was a queer-looking old
woman with a nutcracker face, carrying a large basket
under her arm. She went hobbling along here and there,
in and out, among the children. From the basket came
balls, tops, dolls, and all sorts of toys, for the younger
ones; useful presents for the bigger children. Was there
ever such a curious old woman, or ever a basket that
held so much? How they all laughed when presently
she threw off her mask, bonnet, and cloak; and behold!
Ruby&rsquo;s papa stood before them.</p>
<p>Now it was tea-time, and the little people trooped into
the house. After tea they were requested to walk into the
drawing-room to be introduced to Count Shuffalongofriski,
the Polish dwarf, and his friend Captain Sovveritall, the
wonderful giant. Going into the room, they beheld a little
man standing on a table placed in the recess of a large
window, the curtain being partly drawn round the table.
The dwarf wore a turban and large beard: he had a long
pipe in his mouth, and was dressed up in shawls. He
seemed very affable and pleasant, jabbering away continually
in some unknown language, while now and then
he threw a handful of crackers among the children to
be scrambled for.</p>
<p>Presently an enormous figure appeared stooping to come
through the door of the room. He was covered up with a
long cloak, and was an oddly made giant too, for his
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
shoulders seemed to stick out little more than half-way up
him, and he had a tiny little face, with a voice much
weaker than the dwarf&rsquo;s. He stalked up to the dwarf&rsquo;s
table and stood beside him. At last a little boy of the
party, being very curious, lifted up the giant&rsquo;s cloak to peep
beneath, but happening to pull it at the same time, down
it fell, and there stood Ruby&rsquo;s papa again, with her little
brother Johnnie on his shoulders.</p>
<p>And now the boys were becoming uproarious, and tried
to peep behind the curtain to find out how the dwarf was
made, when their attention was attracted by the sound of
a fiddle playing outside. They saw, in the fading light of
evening, a poor blind man being led up the carriage drive
by a barefooted little girl about the size of Ruby. As the
blind fiddler and his little girl turned the corner of the
drive towards the hall-door, they passed out of sight from
the drawing-room windows, and I observed that Ruby and
three or four other children ran into the hall to meet them.
The boys, however, turned once more to pursue their
investigations concerning the dwarf, and were becoming
quite riotous, when I thought I might as well see what was
going on in the hall, for I heard the fiddler playing lustily.</p>
<p>Entering the hall, what do you suppose I saw? I saw
Ruby and four or five other little girls, including the fiddler&rsquo;s
child among them, dancing away with all their might
to the inspiriting music of the fiddle, fiddler and children
seeming as happy as possible together. But the strangest
sight of all was to see Ruby&rsquo;s pretty blue shoes upon the
dirty stockingless feet of the fiddler&rsquo;s child, while Ruby
herself had only her white silk socks to dance in.</p>
<p>Dear little Ruby! hers was the true spirit of charity,
though certainly not well directed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">MAURICE&rsquo;S FATHER IS ILL.&mdash;A RICH LITTLE GIRL.&mdash;A FAMILY IN DISTRESS.&mdash;WHAT OUGHT MAURICE TO DO?</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-104ds.jpg" alt="S" width="75" height="112" />
</div>
<p>Some months later, when the Spring had
come on, and the sun was beginning to give
warmth, while the air was already perfumed
with violets, Maurice was walking, one
beautiful morning, in the Luxembourg gardens.
He had Cressida with him, whom he
sometimes rode and sometimes led, and
Jacques the old servant was also there. A number of children
were in the gardens, playing at different games, and
enjoying themselves in the bright sunshine. They were
chattering away too as gaily as the little wild birds overhead
were singing in the soft air.</p>
<p>Maurice alone was not amusing himself, and old Jacques
the servant walked after him in silence, looking as sad as
his young master. Alas! my kind-hearted little readers,
you will be grieved, I know, when you hear the cause of
my little friend&rsquo;s sadness: Maurice&rsquo;s father was seriously
ill.</p>
<p>That very morning Maurice had been present, without
any one knowing it, at a consultation between two famous
doctors, who were attending his father. He happened to be
in the drawing-room, standing at a window and half hidden
behind the curtain, when they came in, and they had not
observed him. Although he did not understand all they
said, he heard enough to cause him great unhappiness
and alarm. He had now come into the Luxembourg
gardens&mdash;not because he thought of amusing or enjoying
himself, but because his mamma had wished him to go
out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>

<p class="pcap">MAURICE WAS PRESENT AT A CONSULTATION.</p>
</div>
<p>While he was sitting on Cressida&rsquo;s back, with the reins
thrown carelessly on its neck, and moving at a slow walk
to suit his thoughtful and sad mood, he noticed that a little
girl, rather older than himself, was coming towards him as
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
if she wished to say something. She was accompanied
by a lady, too young to be her mother, of a graceful
figure though simply dressed. The little girl, whose face
expressed a bold and decided character, called out to
Maurice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentleman, sell me your horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell Cressida!&rdquo; cried Maurice, with astonishment.
&ldquo;Oh, no, certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pay you with ten pieces of gold money that I
have here in my purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you&rsquo;ve got ten pieces of gold money of your
own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My very own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do just let me look at them,&rdquo; begged Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said she, opening a pretty little purse with an
air of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lot of gold!&rdquo; exclaimed my little friend, and
he put out his hand to touch it. Then drawing his hand
quickly back, he added: &ldquo;No, no, I cannot sell Cressida.
But tell me, who has given you all this gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my papa. Yesterday was his birthday, and I
repeated to him a bit of poetry&mdash;such pretty poetry!&mdash;wishing
him many happy returns of the day. Miss
Henriette&mdash;she&rsquo;s my English governess, the young lady
you see there&mdash;she had written it out for me. When I
repeated the lines to papa, he gave me these ten napoleons,
and he told me to buy something handsome with them for
myself,&mdash;anything I liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have no idea of selling Cressida,&rdquo; repeated
Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not had him long then, I suppose&mdash;not got
tired of him yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how long; eight or nine
months perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine months! It&rsquo;s an age; I never kept a plaything
for nine months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img id="xxx9" src="images/i-107.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="794" />
<p class="pcap">&ldquo;NO, NO, I CANNOT SELL YOU CRESSIDA.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I give them away or I break them. Don&rsquo;t you get
tired of having the same toys always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cressida is not a common toy to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s very handsome, no doubt; I thought at first
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
he was a real pony. But with ten napoleons you can
buy another,&mdash;you can buy a white one, and that would
be a change, you know. Come, you&rsquo;ll alter your mind,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m sure I shall not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not like me then,&rdquo; replied the little girl, &ldquo;I
am always changing my mind. Yesterday, what I wished
for most in the world was a set of cups and saucers of
S&egrave;vres china for my doll; this morning I wanted most a
coral necklace for myself; then I wanted an ermine muff;
and now I want to buy your horse. Don&rsquo;t I change my
mind often? But your horse I really wish for very much:
the fact is I never saw one like it at any toy-shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall only care for it, you know, till I have a real
pony. My papa has promised to buy me a real pony in
a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your papa is rich then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my papa rich! I should think so indeed. My papa
is a wine-merchant, and he has made thousands upon thousands
and millions upon millions in his business: he&rsquo;s
going to make a great deal more yet too, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This heaping up of millions upon millions caused Maurice
to open his eyes very wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he asked of the young girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am called Adrienne,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adrienne what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adrienne Fallachon, since you wish to know. But
that will not be my name always, for my papa intends me
to marry a duke or a prince when I am old enough. Some
little girls I know turn up their noses at me because my
papa is a wine-merchant, and I told him of it one day.
Oh, he was in such a passion! What names he did call
them! He took me up on his knee, and said he loved me
doubly since my mamma died; and he declared he would
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
make such a deal of money to give me when I marry that
I should be a princess, or a duchess at the least. That&rsquo;s
what he said: isn&rsquo;t he a good papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed he is. But those little girls were very
ill-natured, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, were they not? Suppose now we become great
friends. I shall be here every day, and sometimes we&rsquo;ll
play together: do you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice said he should be very glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve told you my name,&rdquo; went on Adrienne; &ldquo;tell
me now in return, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice de Roisel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice de Roisel! that&rsquo;s a pretty name. Have you
a title? If you have, I&rsquo;ll marry you when you&rsquo;re grown
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as for a title, I really don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ll ask
mamma if I have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do; you need only be a duke, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this she went off to play with her hoop, and
Maurice continued his ride, with Jacques walking by his
side.</p>
<p>As Maurice approached the gate of the garden, he
beheld a sight which filled his kind young heart with pity.
Seated on the pavement outside the garden, and leaning
against the iron railing, was a young woman with three
pretty children. They appeared to be in the deepest
despair, but there was a certain dignity in their grief; they
wept silently, and seemed anxious to avoid the notice of
the passers-by. As he watched them, he thought to himself&mdash;his
mind dwelling upon his own anxiety&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if
their father&rsquo;s dead that they cry so bitterly?&rdquo; He did not
like to speak to them, however, but only looked at them
from a little distance through the railings. Presently one
of the children&mdash;a charming little girl&mdash;looked up at Maurice,
and then he ventured to approach and ask her what
made them so miserable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img id="xxx10" src="images/i-110.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="805" />
<p class="pcap">THEY APPEARED TO BE IN THE DEEPEST DESPAIR.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she replied, speaking bad French with a German
accent, &ldquo;it is the greatest misfortune that could befall
us: we are separated for ever from our father. Our
poor dear papa is expecting us at New York, where he has
some land, and where we could be rich and happy; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
now it is impossible for us to go to him. Alas! there is
nothing for us but to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To die! Oh, don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;it&rsquo;s dreadful,&rdquo; rejoined
Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is dreadful,&rdquo; continued the girl. &ldquo;And my
poor father&mdash;Ah, what grief for him too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does it happen that you cannot go out to
join him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not the means; we are without money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money? I&rsquo;ve got some money.&rdquo; And Maurice hastened
to offer the contents of his little purse&mdash;about five or
six francs.</p>
<p>The little girl did not take them, but turned to her mother,
who was pressing to her heart her other two children,
handsome boys of three and four years old. The mother
and her daughter spoke together for a minute in German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not take what I offer?&rdquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the girl,&mdash;for her mother could not
speak French,&mdash;&ldquo;because, though it is a good deal for you
to give, it would be of no use to us. To save us we want
two hundred francs&mdash;that is, ten gold napoleons. Who
would give them to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten pieces of gold money,&rdquo; cried my little friend.
&ldquo;Wait a minute; I know somebody who has them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave Cressida into the care of Jacques, and running
after Adrienne, took her by the hand, and led her up to this
poor family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give your money to these good people,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; replied Adrienne, astonished; &ldquo;my papa
told me to buy something with the money for myself, and
I&rsquo;m not going to give it to beggars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just consider, Adrienne,&rdquo; said her English governess,
who had followed her, &ldquo;whether you would not do
well to give some help to this unhappy woman and her
little children: such a kind action would be all the kinder
if you do it by the sacrifice of something you intended to
buy for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;But my papa does not wish me to make sacrifices,&rdquo;
said Adrienne. And nothing that her governess or Maurice
could say would induce her to part with her money.</p>
<p>Maurice thought for a moment of going home to his
mother to ask her for the two hundred francs; but remembering
that she would certainly be in his father&rsquo;s sick-room
nursing him, he felt that it would not do to disturb or
trouble her now. Then he turned to Jacques.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you lend me two hundred francs, Jacques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred francs!&rdquo; cried Jacques; &ldquo;why you would
not surely give so much to people you know nothing about.
But at all events I don&rsquo;t possess two hundred francs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so large a sum then?&rdquo; inquired Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more than my wages for half a year come to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young gentleman,&rdquo; said the governess,
addressing Maurice, &ldquo;I see you have a good heart, but
perhaps it would be wise, before you think any more about
helping this poor woman, to inquire what has happened to
throw them suddenly into such a state of destitution. You
see they are quite nicely dressed, and do not look at all as
if they were accustomed to ask for charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to the questions of the governess and Maurice,
the little girl, who was the only one that could speak
French, explained that they were Germans from Nuremburg:
that they had arrived only that morning in Paris
by railway from that city, intending to go on from Paris to
Nantes, where they were to embark for New York. Their
father had gone out to New York about two years before
to settle there: he had been prosperous, and they were
going to join him. Their baggage had been already
seat on from Nuremburg to Nantes, and put on board
the vessel in which their passage had been engaged
and paid for by their father at New York, the captain
being a friend of his.</p>
<p>She said that when they got out of the train at Paris
that morning, they missed a little portmanteau, the only
luggage they carried with them, which contained, besides
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
some change of linen, all the money they had. It had
either been stolen or lost in the confusion of getting out of
the train. So they found themselves now in this great city
without friends and without money, and&mdash;worst of all&mdash;the
vessel would sail to-morrow evening, and unless they could
go on at once their passage would be lost.</p>
<p>She told her story with such earnestness and simplicity
that no one could doubt its truth; and the governess made
one more effort to excite the compassion of her pupil. But
Adrienne was quite insensible to the suffering of others,
and ran off, bowling her hoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Maurice, looking after her, &ldquo;I know one
way of finding the money, if I could but make up my mind
to do it: I could sell my horse to Adrienne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Master Maurice?&rdquo; exclaimed
Jacques. &ldquo;It is impossible. Sell Cressida, that you
refused so bravely to part with to your uncle! Think of
your promise to Fritz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I made that promise, Fritz told me expressly
that I might sell it only in order to help any one who was
in great distress. Would not he have wished to help this
poor woman and these children? That I am sure he
would. Still it breaks my heart to part with Cressida:
I can hardly bear to think about it: but I will do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adrienne ran up with her hoop at this moment, and her
joy was unbounded when she heard that Maurice consented
at last to sell Cressida to her for the ten pieces of gold.
She kissed Maurice and she kissed the little horse. She
clapped her hands and danced about with delight.</p>
<p>As soon as her expressions of joy had begun to subside
Maurice said to her very seriously:&mdash;&ldquo;I have one favour
to ask of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That when you get tired of Cressida you will not throw
it aside, or give it to the first person who comes in the way,
without knowing whether it is taken care of or not. The
favour I ask is that you will just think of it, and care for
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
it a little sometimes, even after it no longer amuses
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that I certainly will,&rdquo; said Adrienne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
keep it myself as long as it&rsquo;s in good condition; that is,
till I break it, I mean; and when I have quite done with
it, I won&rsquo;t be so cruel as to throw it away, or give it to the
first who asks me. No, you may be quite easy about that:
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. When it&rsquo;s broken, I&rsquo;ll make it
a present to the children of my nurse. They are great fat
country children, with cheeks like rosy apples; but oh, so
stupid! and not difficult to please, I assure you. If Cressida
has lost two or three of its legs they will admire it all
the same, and it will amuse them immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This picture of the probable future in store for the little
horse was not calculated to comfort Maurice, whatever it
was meant to do. Indeed he felt very much inclined to be
off the bargain, and tears began to trickle down his
cheeks.</p>
<p>If the actors in this scene had not been so engrossed
with the matter they were discussing, they would certainly
have noticed a rather old gentleman, who was walking up
and down, with his hands behind him, at a few paces from
where they stood, and who was evidently listening to all
they said. At this moment, when Maurice was looking
very unhappy&mdash;for his delight at helping this poor family
did not prevent his feeling a sort of horror to think that
Fritz&rsquo;s wonderful mechanical work should pass into such
bad hands,&mdash;just at this moment, the old gentleman came
straight up to them, and spoke to Maurice.</p>
<p>What he said to Maurice, and what he did, are too
important to the course of this story to come in at the end
of a chapter; and I will reserve them for the beginning of
the next. But I do not mind letting my little readers
know at once that Adrienne did not have the horse after
all.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-118da.jpg" alt="A" width="46" height="46" />
</div>
<p>A little boy called Tom was very fond
of teasing. He used to call&mdash;&ldquo;Bo!&rdquo; in
the baby&rsquo;s ear, and startle the poor little
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
thing. One Sunday he pinned a pocket-handkerchief
on to nurse&rsquo;s back as she was going to
church, and she thought people were admiring her
when they looked back. Another day he put some
bran into her teapot, and nurse wondered why
her tea was not so good as usual. Then he got
a frightful mask, and jumping out of a dark
corner, with a howl, nearly frightened the nursery-maid
into a fit.</p>
<p>One day there was a child&rsquo;s party. It was sister
Mary&rsquo;s birthday. When the children were taking
their seats at supper, naughty Tom went behind
Mary just as she was sitting down, and pulled her
chair away. Mary fell, and hit her head against
the fender.</p>
<p>Poor Mary was seriously hurt, and for a minute
or two she lay insensible. Then Tom was really
sorry, and repented what he had done. For all
that, though, he was well whipped, and sent off
to school next day. I daresay you will agree
with me that he deserved his punishment.</p>

<h2 id="c38">HERONS.</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-121dt.jpg" alt="T" width="102" height="117" />
</div>
<p>To-day our natural history picture
shows three very funny long-legged
birds; they look at first sight very
like storks, but these birds are herons.</p>
<p>The heron, though much less common
than in former days, still holds
its place among familiar British birds,
being occasionally seen on the banks
of almost every river or lake. This
bird is about three feet in length, the bill being longer
than the head, and the wings when spread measure five
feet across; with these large strong wings it can fly to a
great height. The heron lives on fish, which it swallows
whole, and in great numbers; it can neither swim nor
dive, but it wades into the water as far as its long legs will
carry it with safety, and stands there as still as if carved
out of wood, with its long neck drawn in, and its head
resting between the shoulders. It will watch with patience
for hours till a fish or a frog comes within its reach, when
it stretches out its long neck suddenly, and snatches up
its prey with its sharp bill. It mostly prefers to stand
under the shadow of a tree, bush, or bank; and from its perfect
stillness, and the sober colour of its plumage, it seems
often to escape the observation even of the fish themselves.</p>
<p>In old times in England, the sport called hawking,
which consisted in the chase of herons by hawks or falcons
trained for the purpose, was a very favourite one among
both gentlemen and ladies. Young hawks procured from
their nests in Iceland or Norway, and carefully trained,
were of great value. The sport was generally enjoyed
on horseback, and both ladies and gentlemen usually
carried the hawks perched upon their wrists, the birds&rsquo;
heads being covered with a hood till the moment came for
letting them fly.</p>
<p>When the heron was discovered, he would soon become
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
aware of the approach of the hawking party; and spreading
his broad wings, and stretching out his long neck in front,
and his long legs behind, would rise majestically in the
air. Then the hawk&rsquo;s hood was removed, and as soon as
he caught sight of the heron, he was let fly in pursuit.</p>
<p>Now a hawk cannot strike unless it is above its prey,
and the heron seems instinctively to be aware of this. It
used to be thought a fine sight to see these two birds
striving to rise each above the other. Round and round
they went, wheeling in a succession of circles, always
higher and higher. At length the hawk rose high enough
to shoot down upon the heron. Sometimes he was received
upon the long sharp bill of the latter, and simply spitted
himself; but generally he would break the wing of the
heron, or clutch him with beak and claws, when the
two came fluttering down together.</p>
<p>This sport has now fallen into disuse, and English
herons lead a peaceful life enough. There are some at
the Zoological gardens, and I think you will laugh to see
them standing there at the edge of their pond, with heads
sunk between their shoulders, looking like long-nosed old
gentlemen in pointed tail-coats.</p>

<h3>COCO AND MARQUIS.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-123dt.jpg" alt="T" width="94" height="173" />
</div>
<p>The next of her pets that Aunt Totty
told us about were a mule and a dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dears,&rdquo; said Aunt Totty,
&ldquo;Marquis was certainly a splendid
animal; as large as a fine horse, as
strong as a bull, and wonderfully fleet.
We used to drive him about in a light
two-wheeled carriage, a kind of cabriolet,
which was the carriage most
used in that part of France in those
days. I must tell you that what I am
going to relate happened when I was quite a little child,
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
which of course is a long time ago, and we were living at
the time in a chateau, or large country-house, in the south
of France. There were large forests in that part of the
country, and the house was a long way off from any town.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-124.jpg" alt="Dog and mule" width="500" height="353" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, handsome and strong Marquis certainly was, but
that was about all you could say in his favour, for he had
a detestable temper. I hardly know why I call Marquis
one of my pets, for we children were never allowed to drive
him, hardly even to stroke him, lest he should kick or
bite; and he was addicted to both these bad habits.
Whenever he thought he had hurt anyone, or done mischief
of any kind, you might see him shake all over, as if he was
having a good quiet laugh all to himself. Once he succeeded
in breaking the traces and getting free from the
carriage: then he indulged in something more than a quiet
chuckle, and fell to neighing or braying&mdash;for I hardly
know which to call it&mdash;with all his might, till we were nearly
deafened by the horrid noise. I remember another occasion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
when he succeeded in upsetting the little carriage
and breaking the shafts. My mother and I and the
coachman were all thrown out. Luckily we were not much
hurt; and while we were picking ourselves up, Marquis
stood looking at us with an air of triumph, and amused
himself by kicking up the dust with his hoofs till we were
almost smothered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marquis had, however, one tender place in his heart,
and that was occupied by our dog Coco. Coco was a
spaniel; no great beauty perhaps; but he was as good and
amiable as Marquis was the reverse. How two creatures so
unlike in disposition&mdash;one so good-hearted, the other so
vicious&mdash;could have struck up such a friendship, I never
could make out. If Coco went into the field where Marquis
was grazing, the mule would run up to him directly, and I
have even seen the two rub their noses together as if they
were kissing. Coco had a comfortable bed in the kitchen,
but he preferred at night going to sleep upon the straw in
the little out-house which served as a stable for Marquis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winter we were at the chateau happened to be
unusually severe, and snow was on the ground for many
days. It was always known that there were wolves in the
forest, though they were rarely seen; but during the cold
weather it was said that one or two had approached the
village. One evening we were all sitting round the fire,
Coco being in the midst of us, when he suddenly pricked
up his ears, as if he heard a sound outside, and immediately
rushed out of the room. Directly afterwards we
heard a dreadful howling, and papa and the boys ran out
to see what it was. They found Coco and a wolf waging
a dreadful combat just outside the door of the shed where
Marquis was kept. This was not the regular stable for the
horses, and was rather separated from the other buildings
of the chateau. On the approach of human beings the
wolf ran off, but he had inflicted a mortal wound upon
poor Coco, who was just expiring when his rescuers arrived.
He died to defend his friend Marquis.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c41">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>THE MAN WITH THE WITHERED HAND HEALED.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-128do.jpg" alt="O" width="86" height="167" />
</div>
<p>Our Saviour&rsquo;s next miracle, after the miraculous
draught of fishes which I described
in our last Sunday talk, took place also at
Capernaum, and consisted in healing the
mother of the wife of Simon Peter the fisherman.
Peter had become a disciple of
Jesus, and indeed was soon afterwards created
one of the twelve apostles. The Master
often visited the house of His disciple; and
one day on entering it, He was told that
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
Peter&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother lay seriously ill. Christ immediately
went into the room of the sick woman; stood over her,
and holding her hand, bade the fever leave her. She
arose at once from her bed, perfectly well; not merely
better; not weak, as people usually are on first recovering
from a fever, but quite well. St. Matthew says of her:&mdash;&ldquo;And
she arose and ministered to them:&rdquo; meaning
that she was able to get up and attend to her household
duties as usual.</p>
<p>Our Saviour now went down to Nazareth, where, as you
know, my dear children, He was brought up, and where
He had lived for many years unknown and in poverty.
He there performed many wonderful miracles, healing the
sick, and doing good to the poor or afflicted who came to
Him. But you must not expect me to describe to you all
His wonderful works of this kind; I shall tell you only of
the most important, that you may learn the loving kindness
and mercy of Him who &ldquo;bore our sins and carried our
sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It often happened on the Sabbath, in the cool of the
evening, that the sick were brought out on their beds or
couches to Jesus to be healed. They were not brought
till the sun was setting, for fear of breaking the commandment
which forbids all manner of work on the Sabbath:
but the Jewish Sabbath ending at the setting of the sun,
people did not scruple to bring their sick to be healed by
Jesus after that hour. And He healed all that were
brought to Him.</p>
<p>But once on a Sabbath day, before the hour of sunset, a
man came to Him for help. The hand of this man was
withered and helpless, and he came to Christ hoping that
He would heal it. We are told in the Bible that the
Scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see whether He
would heal on the Sabbath day, that they might find an
accusation against Him for breaking the commandment.
But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to the man which
had the withered hand: &ldquo;Rise up and stand forth in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
midst.&rdquo; And he arose and stood forth. Then said Jesus
unto them: &ldquo;I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the
Sabbath day to do good or to do evil; to save life or to
destroy it?&rdquo; And looking round upon them all, He said
unto the man: &ldquo;Stretch forth thy hand!&rdquo; And he did so,
and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p>
<p>Now our Saviour did not mean by performing this
miracle to teach that the observance of the Sabbath should
be lightly thought of. The teaching of our Lord and His
example do not tend to lessen our reverence for this holy-day.
But what He intended to show was that works of
mercy are quite consistent with the holiness of the Sabbath,
and that the Sabbath was intended for the advantage and
happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>You would think that the gentle reproof of our Lord
would have made these Scribes and Pharisees repent: but
it was not so. They felt that they were put to shame
before the people, and their rage and hatred against our
Saviour increased. They felt that they could not stand
before His teaching, even had this teaching not been sustained
as it was by such signs and wonders. They were
losing influence, and if Christ was allowed to go on, their
own power would be gone.</p>
<p>Then the Pharisees and Scribes went and held council
together against Jesus, consulting how they should destroy
Him.</p>

<h2 id="c42">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3>FRANK.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-131di.jpg" alt="I" width="36" height="76" />
</div>
<p>I think you would like to hear about a little friend
of mine called Frank. That is, he <i>was</i> a little friend
of mine, for he is grown into a man now; and
though a friend still, he is by no means little, being
above six feet high. However, what I am going to
tell you of him occurred years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Frank&rsquo;s father died when he was quite young, and his
mother, marrying again, went out to India; so it happened
that he lived in London with his grandfather and grandmother.
They, of course, were quite old people, and he
was always very glad to spend a part of his holidays with
some cousins at their house in the country, which was very
near to where I lived. I was not quite grown up at that
time, but I was so much older than Frank that he looked
upon me as a very wise person, and one quite fitted to
give him advice.</p>
<p>Now Frank had a great talent for drawing, and I think
that was what drew us together, for I had a turn that way
also. He used to sketch the beautiful scenery in the neighbourhood;
and, although he only sketched in pencil, he
obtained good effects of distance, gave correctly the foliage
of the different trees, and, above all, he seemed by natural
genius always to choose just the subjects which formed a
nice composition as a picture.</p>
<p>He was at this time about twelve or thirteen years of age,
and whenever he talked to me about his own future, which
he very often did, I could not help encouraging him to become
an artist. His grandfather, I knew, had other views,
and intended him to be a merchant, there being some advantageous
opening for him in that way. Still I advised
Frank at least to let his grandfather know how much he
wished to be an artist, and to show him some of his
sketches; &ldquo;because,&rdquo; as I said, &ldquo;if he consents, it is time
you should be put in the way of studying art properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, Frank followed my advice. After spending his
holidays in the country, he went to pass one day in town
at his grandfather&rsquo;s before going to school. In the evening
after dinner, when he was sitting with his grandfather
and grandmother, he suddenly broke out with:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpapa dear, I want to be an artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An artist!&rdquo; said grandpapa; &ldquo;why, what fancy is this?
I didn&rsquo;t know you had a taste that way. Here, let me see
if you can draw this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>He placed before his grandson a small ancient vase,
which he took from a glass case; for Frank&rsquo;s grandfather,
I must tell you, was a great collector of ancient things&mdash;relics,
and curiosities.</p>
<p>Frank took his place at the opposite side of the table,
and set to work. At last he brought the paper round to
grandpapa. There was the vase, very fairly and correctly
copied:&mdash;But I think I had better give you an account of
what happened in grandpapa&rsquo;s own words, as he told it
all to me some time afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vase was well drawn, no doubt,&rdquo; said grandpapa,
&ldquo;but after all it was nothing extraordinary; and I was
giving the paper back to Frank, when I noticed that there
was some drawing on the other side. Looking at it again,
I saw two heads&mdash;mere sketches, but better likenesses I
never saw. One was his grandmamma; there she was to
the very life. The other&mdash;well, the other was a caricature,
rather than a portrait, of me. I was made to appear ugly
and ridiculous, instead of the good-looking old gentleman
I am;&rdquo; (He said this laughing) &ldquo;still, it was a likeness, I
confess. I tried to be angry, but laughed instead, and exclaimed:
&lsquo;Ah, Frank, Frank! you shall be an artist if you
like; you certainly have talent, but you must turn it to
better account than by making caricatures of your old
grandfather.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank is now grown up, and has already obtained some
fame as an artist. I saw two pictures of his at the Royal
Academy exhibition the other day, which were admired
and praised by everybody.</p>

<p>Look at that fine stag in the picture,
keeping guard while the does and fawns
are feeding! How watchful he looks,
with his head erect; and how grandly
his antlers spread out, as we see them
against the soft twilight sky! Deer in
their wild state are timid creatures; at
least, they are very much afraid of human beings; and it is
difficult to approach them. Shooting the wild deer in the
Highlands of Scotland is considered excellent sport: it is
called Deer-stalking. Large herds are to be found there
among the mountains, but the greatest caution and skill
are needed to get near enough to have a shot at them without
being observed. Of course the deer we see in parks
are comparatively tame: they are generally fallow deer;
while those of the Highlands are a larger and stronger
species, called red deer.</p>
<p>I daresay many of you little people who read this have
been to Richmond park, and seen the herds of graceful
fallow deer there. If you go up very gently to them perhaps
they will come and eat bread out of your hand. At
least I remember when I was a little girl, and passed a
summer at Richmond, I succeeded once in making two
young fawns come and share my biscuit with me. Shall I
tell you how it happened?</p>
<p>One morning I had not learnt my lessons as well as
usual; perhaps I had been watching the butterflies from the
window flitting about in the sunshine instead of looking at
my book; at any rate Miss Dobson, my governess, thought
it necessary to punish me. Now I was too big to be put
into the corner, being nine years old; and the mode of
punishment she always adopted was to avoid speaking to
me for an hour or so, and at the same time to put on an
expression of face at once severe and sorrowful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>After school hours we went out for our walk in the park
as usual, and, as I was an affectionate and very talkative
child, you may suppose that Miss Dobson&rsquo;s gloomy face
and freezing silence made me very miserable. If I ventured
upon a remark the answer never extended beyond &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no&rdquo;; sometimes not even that. We had two great dogs,
which generally went out with us on our walk; but when I
was under punishment, even their companionship was not
allowed.</p>
<p>At last Miss Dobson seated herself under a great oak,
and began to read a book she had brought out with her.
Then I wandered a little way off, picking the pretty wild
flowers that grew amongst the fern. The birds were singing
in the sunshine, the bees were humming, everything
with life seemed to enjoy that life but me. Some deer
were lying under the shadow of the trees not far away, and
I observed that two pretty little fawns, standing nearer to
me than the rest, were watching me. I had some biscuit
in my pocket, intended for the dogs; and taking a piece in
my hand, I walked up very softly to the little creatures.
They looked at me, as I approached, with a frightened
glance from their great dark eyes; but I fancy there must
have been a sad and subdued expression in my childish face
which took away from my appearance what might have
terrified them, and on consideration they decided to
remain.</p>
<p>Holding out the biscuit, I dropped it near them; then
up jumped Mrs. Doe, and came forward to see what it
was I offered to her children. I threw her a piece also,
which she took and munched gladly, and the little ones
followed her example. I cannot describe to you what a
comfort it was to me in my trouble to find that these pretty
creatures were not afraid of me, and did not shun me. I
no longer felt solitary; no longer without friends or companions.
Presently they took the biscuit from my fingers,
and when I had no more to give them, they still thrust
their soft noses into my little hand, and let me stroke them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>But my pleasure did not last long. A fine stag, the
leader of the herd, who was lying in the midst of them, and
who, I suppose, had been half asleep, seemed suddenly to
become conscious of my presence, and took alarm. Jumping
up, he bounded away, followed by the rest of the herd,
and my two little friends went after the others.</p>
<p>Looking at them as they fled away from me, I felt more
forlorn and solitary than ever, and tears came into my eyes.
Presently Miss Dobson came up to me; she had been
watching me from a distance, and now finding that I was
crying, her manner changed, and she was very kind. In
fact, my punishment was over for the time, and I think
she began to find that it was a kind of punishment which I
felt more than she intended.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A MAN OF SCIENCE.&mdash;MAURICE PARTS WITH THE HORSE.&mdash;JOURNEY TO NICE.&mdash;RETURN HOME.&mdash;AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-144.jpg" alt="A" width="128" height="200" />
</div>
<p>At the close of the last chapter I
told you that an old gentleman
had been looking on from a little
distance, while Maurice and
Adrienne were discussing the
sale of the horse. At last the
old gentleman came up to Maurice,
and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to sell that
little wooden horse, whose mechanism
is so ingenious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Maurice,
crying while he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem very sorry to part
with it. Tell me exactly why
you sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice pointed to the poor
family, sitting there against the railing of the garden; and
related all that had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good boy,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;listen
now: I also wish to help this poor woman. Will you let
me join you in the good work? That will not make your
merit the less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think about my own merit,&rdquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; replied the gentleman; &ldquo;charity does
not think of self. I mean to say, if you would practise
charity in a true and holy spirit, you must forget yourself
completely. You are too young, perhaps, to understand
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
all that; but if you remember my words, they will grow up
in your mind as a young tree grows in a good soil. Now,
as to helping this poor woman and her children: she wants
two hundred francs, you say. I will give her half that sum
from myself; and I will lend you another hundred francs,
that you may give them to her on your own part. Then
instead of selling your clever little horse to this young
lady, you shall leave it with me for a time as security for
the repayment of the hundred francs. Your mamma gives
you money sometimes, I daresay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; put aside all the money she gives you till
you have got together a hundred francs. It won&rsquo;t take
you long. You must do without sugar-plums, and cakes,
and many a toy that you would otherwise buy. In less
than six months I have no doubt you will have the money.
Let me see; this is the twelfth of February: we will fix
the twelfth of August as the day when you will bring me
the hundred francs and take back your horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose I have not the money by that time?&rdquo;
urged Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll have it. All I fear is that your father or
mother may give it you on purpose to pay me, and not let
you save it out of your usual pocket-money. But I will
see them or write to them about that. Remember, my
dear boy, that an action is only really noble when it
requires self-sacrifice of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My little readers may imagine with what eagerness
Maurice accepted this proposition. Adrienne at first was
very angry, and sulked and pouted for a few minutes; then
seeing some young friends come into the gardens, she ran
off to play with them, and seemed to forget the horse
very soon.</p>
<p>The gentleman tore out a leaf from his pocket-book, and
wrote on it in pencil a formal acknowledgment of his having
received the wooden horse in pledge for a loan of one hundred
francs; the horse to be restored within six months on
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
repayment of the money. He signed his name to the
paper, and handed it to Maurice.</p>

<p class="pcap">HE WENT AWAY, LEADING CRESSIDA BY THE BRIDLE.</p>
</div>
<p>On reading it, Maurice was surprised to see the name of
Duberger. He recognised it as the name of one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
most distinguished members of the Academy of sciences;
a name of European celebrity. The little boy looked up at
his new friend with an expression of curiosity and admiration,
at which the latter seemed both amused and pleased.</p>
<p>Mr. Duberger at that time was not really old&mdash;at least
not old for a philosopher and man of science. He looked
old because his long hair was grey, his figure was stooping,
and his dress neglected. But, for all that, his appearance
was calculated to inspire respect and sympathy, while his
face wore an expression at once of goodness and intelligence.
He embraced Maurice, bidding him tell his father
and mother all that had happened; he went away leading
Cressida by the bridle, and leaving Maurice to give the
two hundred francs to the poor woman himself.</p>
<p>Thus at last Maurice and his horse were parted, though
after all he was not breaking his promise to Fritz. He
had resisted the temptation of exchanging Cressida for
Eus&egrave;be&rsquo;s pretty goat&mdash;the gentle, graceful Jeanne. He
had resisted persuasions, entreaties, and the offer of many
a beautiful toy. Even when his uncle, by way of trying
him, pretended that he wished to have the little mechanical
horse to amuse him on board ship, Maurice had remembered,
and still kept, his promise. Now, he parted with
Cressida for the sake of helping a poor family in distress;
and Fritz had expressly said that for such an object only
Maurice might sell the horse. Besides, was he not to have
the horse again in six months?</p>
<p>When he presented the money to the poor woman, she
showed some confusion at receiving so large a sum from the
hands of a child. Maurice explained to the little girl, who
acted as interpreter, that he was not their only benefactor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duberger! Maurice de Roisel!&rdquo; the poor little girl
repeated several times; then continued, &ldquo;I will teach my
brothers to say those two names; we will never forget them;
they will be as dear to us as the names of our own father
and mother. Our name is Kirchner: our father is Leopold
Kirchner, formerly of Nuremburg, where he was a blacksmith
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
well known throughout the city for his skill. Now
he is rich, and a proprietor of land in the United States of
America, a country beyond the seas a long way from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother took Maurice&rsquo;s two hands in hers, and said
some words in German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother says,&rdquo; explained the little daughter, &ldquo;that
you are born with divine charity in your heart, and she
prays God to lead you by the hand through your life, on
the path that leads to heaven. She prays, besides, that
happiness may fall on you and all who are dear to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, above all,&rdquo; replied my little friend, deeply
touched, &ldquo;that my dear father may be restored to health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he took leave of the poor family to
whom he had proved such a benefactor, and hastened
home, anxious to learn how his father was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father!&mdash;how is he?&rdquo; he asked of the servant, as
the door was opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My master has been asking for you, sir,&rdquo; replied the
servant; then, seeing the tears in Maurice&rsquo;s eyes, he added:
&ldquo;but you must not let him see you cry, or he will think he
is worse than he really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tears come to my eyes in spite of me,&rdquo; replied
my little friend, drying his eyes and checking his tears as
well as he could.</p>
<p>Maurice went into his father&rsquo;s room, which appeared
almost dark to him. The poor invalid&rsquo;s eyes were weak and
could not support the light. Maurice, impressed by the
silence and darkness of the room, walked as quietly as possible
on tiptoe up to his mother, whom he could distinguish
sitting by the side of the bed. She was praying silently
to herself, but on seeing her little boy, she took him in her
arms, and leant with him over his father&rsquo;s bed, who pressed
him to his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, my dear child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice could restrain his tears no longer, and his father
observed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you cry, my darling boy?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
think me very ill? But don&rsquo;t be alarmed; God is all
powerful, and may save me yet. Take courage; it will all
pass away. I shall be cured before long; and, when the
weather gets fine, I will take walks in the Luxembourg
gardens with you and Cressida. Do not cry like that, my
child, you will make yourself ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My little friend&rsquo;s emotion was uncontrollable, and he was
led out of the room by his mother, while the poor father
sank back upon his pillow exhausted with the few words
he had spoken.</p>
<p>The next morning, when Jacques came into Maurice&rsquo;s
room to wake him, the first words spoken by the little boy
were to inquire after his father. Jacques replied that the
doctor, who had been there late the evening before, had
declared that his patient was better, and had told Mrs. de
Roisel that he had great hope now of his recovery. Maurice
felt happier than he had done since he was present at the
consultation of the doctors the morning before. Then, as
he looked round the room, he saw Cressida&rsquo;s empty stable,
and occupied as his thoughts were by his father, he still
felt inclined to shed a tear at the sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Jacques,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had a dream
about Fritz in the night. I thought that I saw him, and I
was afraid he would ask me what I had done with Cressida;
but instead of that, he took me in his arms, and embraced
me, and called me his dear good boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hope expressed by the doctor that Mr. de Roisel
would yet recover proved to be well founded, and when the
month of April came on he had regained his strength
sufficiently to bear a journey to Nice, so as to escape the
sudden changes of temperature to which Paris is subject in
the spring. He made the journey, accompanied by his
wife and son. Arriving at Nice, they took a pretty villa,
having a view of the sea on one side, and, on the other,
delicious garden, in which my little friend was surprised to
find rose-trees, lilacs, and other plants in full bloom,
which at Paris had scarcely begun to bud.</p>

<img id="xxx12" src="images/i-150.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="358" />
<p class="pcap">THEY HEARD A GREAT NOISE OF CRACKING OF WHIPS.</p>
</div>
<p>The climate of Nice agreed with Mr. de Roisel so well
that they stayed there nearly four months, and it was
already the beginning of August when the family returned
once more to their own home&mdash;the pretty comfortable old
house where I first introduced Maurice to my little readers.
Maurice was heartily glad to be back again at his own
country-home, where he had his own little garden, where
he knew everybody in the village, and where even the
trees in the wood, and the little winding river with its
pretty water-lilies, seemed like old friends to him.</p>
<p>The very first day of his arrival at home, the little boy
ran off to the cottage of Fritz, to see if he had returned.
He found it shut up, and no one in the village had heard
anything about him since his departure. Although Maurice
felt rather anxious at Fritz&rsquo;s prolonged absence, it yet
afforded him a sort of satisfaction; for he would have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
sorry that Fritz, on their first meeting, should find him without
the horse. A few days more, and he hoped to be in
possession of it again.</p>
<p>In fact he had already collected together, out of the savings
of his pocket-money, the sum of a hundred francs;
and the day after their arrival at home, his father wrote to
Mr. Duberger to say that he should have the pleasure of
bringing his little boy, on the twelfth of the month, to pay
him a visit and to redeem the horse.</p>
<p>On the morning of the twelfth, my little friend and his
father were just preparing to start, when they heard a
sound of carriage wheels and horses&rsquo; hoofs, accompanied
by a great noise of cracking of whips, on the drive leading
to the house. A minute afterwards a carriage with four
horses and postillions drew up at the door.</p>
<p>From this carriage descended Eus&egrave;be and his father.
They were not expected, and never were visitors less
wished for. Mr. de Malassise began by making their
excuses for arriving so unexpectedly, and explained the
reason. He said that Eus&egrave;be had heard only the day
before of Maurice&rsquo;s return, and a violent fancy had seized
him suddenly to come and pay a visit to his cousin. It
had been impossible to persuade Eus&egrave;be to delay the visit
till they could write and give notice of their intention.
Eus&egrave;be, he said, had insisted upon starting early that
morning; and had he been thwarted, that terrible attack
of nervous fever, so much dreaded by his parents, might
have come on at last. So they had made the journey with
post-horses, and there they were!</p>
<p>It was a sad disappointment to Maurice that his visit to
Mr. Duberger should be put off, but there was no alternative;
and after all it was only a delay of perhaps a couple
of days. Cressida could remain without inconvenience for
another forty-eight hours at Mr. Duberger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So thought our little Maurice; but we shall see presently
what serious consequences arose from that delay of only
a couple of days.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a poor woman
who had five children. The eldest, Tom,
went to school, but the others stayed at
home with Jane, the eldest girl, to take care of
them; Jane was seven years old.</p>
<p>One day Jane&rsquo;s mother went out, telling Jane to
be quiet, and careful with the little ones, and on no
account to touch anything that could hurt them or
herself. For some time after their mother went out
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
the children were good and played with some old
dolls. But presently Jane thought she would light
a fire;&mdash;was she not naughty? She got on a chair
to reach the matches from the mantel-piece, and in
doing so, she knocked down an iron candlestick
upon her brother Willy&rsquo;s head. Willy screamed,
and no wonder, for he had a great cut on his forehead.
As soon as Willy stopped crying, Jane
lighted the fire, and then she thought she would
boil some potatoes; she found a saucepan, and
popped them in.</p>
<p>The children crowded round her; she raised her
arm to drive them off, over went the pan with the
boiling water all over them. Jane&rsquo;s ankle was
terribly scalded, as well as Willy&rsquo;s arm and Peter&rsquo;s
leg; and baby was scalded all over.</p>
<p>Just then in came mother. The doctor had to be
sent for, and it was weeks before the children were
well. So much for disobedience.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-156di.jpg" alt="I" width="78" height="113" />
</div>
<p>In a cottage that stood on a great range of
mountains in Germany, there once lived a
poor woman who had a little child and a
flock of sheep. Now, one day she sat with
her little child in the forest, and gave the
child some porridge out of a pipkin, and the
sheep were nibbling the grass in the glades
around. But in the thick parts of the forest there were
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
wicked wolves, and when the sheep went further away under
the trees, the woman thought, &ldquo;Perhaps the wolves may
attack them.&rdquo; So she gave the child the bowl with porridge
in it, and a wooden spoon, and bade her eat it; saying,
&ldquo;Be sure not fill the spoon too full,&rdquo; and off she went
after the sheep.</p>
<p>And as the child sat alone, and ate and ate, there came
a big she-wolf out of the forest; and she ran straight to
the child and took hold of her by the jacket at the back,
and carried her into the forest. So when the mother came
back the child was gone; the bowl was there, but the spoon
was not with it, for the child had held the spoon fast in her
little hand. Directly the poor mother saw the child was
gone, she thought the wolf must have taken it, so she ran
back to the village, and called the people to come and help
her to find her child.</p>
<p>Meantime a man who had lost his way in the wood, and
was wandering about among the bushes, heard a sound of
talking near him, and thought at once, &ldquo;There must be
some people here;&rdquo; and a little voice kept saying, &ldquo;Go,
or I&rsquo;ll give you something!&rdquo; And when he looked through
the bushes, to see what this might be, behold! there sat a
little child on the ground, and six little wolf-cubs round
her, which kept snapping at her hands; but the old she-wolf
was gone. Each time that a little wolf-cub snapped at
her hands, the child hit it on the nose with the wooden
spoon, and said, &ldquo;Go, or I&rsquo;ll give you something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man ran up quickly, and beat off the wolf-cubs with
his stick, so they all ran away. Then he took up the child
in his arms, for he feared the old wolf might come back.
In a short time he met the villagers coming out to kill the
wolf, and with them was the child&rsquo;s mother. How rejoiced
she was! How she thanked the man, and still more God,
that her child was saved!</p>

<h2 id="c51">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>STILLING THE TEMPEST.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-160di.jpg" alt="I" width="67" height="138" />
</div>
<p>In our last Sunday talk I told you how our
Saviour healed the man with the withered
hand: and how angry the Pharisees were at
His doing so on the Sabbath. You understand,
my children, that Christ was not
teaching us to regard the Sabbath with
less reverence, but He showed us by His
example that works of mercy and kindness
are consistent with the holiness of Sunday.
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
Christ said, &ldquo;It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;
To attend the sick, comfort the afflicted, teach the young
and ignorant,&mdash;these are all good works; and to do these
is &ldquo;to do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pharisees and Scribes were always on the watch for
something, either in the doctrines that Christ taught, or in
His acts, which might serve as a ground for arresting Him
and bringing Him to trial. But besides the open enmity
of these men, our Saviour had a difficulty to contend with
in the want of thorough and perfect faith even in those
who dearly loved Him&mdash;His own disciples; and some of
the miracles He performed had for their object chiefly to
confirm and strengthen the faith of His followers. The
miracle I am going to tell you of&mdash;the stilling of the
tempest&mdash;was one of these, and was witnessed only by
the disciples who were with Him in the ship.</p>
<p>Not only was faith necessary for the disciples in order
to give them confidence in the protection of God while they
helped our Saviour in His work, or when they should have
to continue it after Him, but perfect faith was needed
before they could acquire the power of performing miracles.
On one occasion, when some of them had attempted the
miraculous cure of a boy, and failed, they asked Christ
the reason of their failure. He replied: &ldquo;Because of your
unbelief. If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
place; and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apostles&mdash;that is, the chosen few, who continued the
mission of our Saviour after His crucifixion&mdash;had the
power of working miracles conferred upon them. We may
assume therefore that their faith was perfect. But let us
come to the miracle I have to tell you of today.</p>
<p>Our Saviour had been teaching the people all day from
a boat on the lake of Galilee; the people being ranged
along the shore, so that they could all hear without crowding
in upon Him. When evening came on, He desired
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
the people to return to their homes, and bade His disciples
put their boat from the land, and depart to the other side
of the lake. As they left the shore, the water was smooth
and calm, and the cool air blew gently from the mountains.
Christ, tired out with the exertion of the day, lay down to
rest and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The boat bore them over the rippling waves, and the
disciples conversed most likely about the teaching of our
Saviour which they had heard that day. They thought
very probably that their faith in Him was quite strong:
but it was soon to be tried. A terrible storm arose suddenly;
the wind blew furiously; the great waves arose
around the little vessel, and broke over its sides; the sail
was torn, the mast broken. Then the disciples, in terror,
rushed to our Saviour to wake Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, save
us! we perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ said unto them: &ldquo;Why are ye fearful? oh, ye of
little faith!&rdquo; and He rebuked the winds and the sea, and
there was a great calm.</p>
<p>But even after this the disciples did not seem thoroughly
to understand our Saviour; for the scripture tells us that
&ldquo;they marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this
that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c52">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3>LENA.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-164dl.jpg" alt="L" width="89" height="121" />
</div>
<p>Lena is the name of the little friend of
mine I am going to tell you about.
You may see by the picture that she
is not an English child, nor does she
belong to the class which we call gentlefolk.
Lena is German, and the
daughter of a fisherman; nevertheless
she is one of my dearest little friends.
She lives in a cottage on the banks of the river Rhine, a
short distance from the city of Coblenz. Her father earns
his living as a boatman and fisherman upon the river; her
mother takes care of the cottage, of their only child, and
of the poultry: she finds plenty of time for making lace
besides. I will tell you how I came to make little Lena&rsquo;s
acquaintance.</p>
<p>I passed one summer not long ago at Coblenz, at
a villa on the banks of the river just outside the city.
One evening, after a very hot day, I wandered a little way
along the road by the side of the great beautiful river. I
watched the lights gradually appearing, like fireflies in the
distance, in the windows of the old castle or fortress of
Ehrenbreitstein, which crowns a rocky hill on the opposite
bank; and I watched, too, the lights and shadows borne
on the breast of the swift river beneath. I stood looking
at the restless ever-flowing water, comparing the river in
its course to my own life, or to the lives of others; and
thinking many thoughts which you, my little readers,
would hardly understand.</p>
<p>At length my meditations were disturbed by a woman
who came out of a cottage close by, and who, walking to
the edge of the bank, there sat down, threw her apron
over her head, and began to cry bitterly. It seemed as if
she had come out of the cottage on purpose to have a good
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
cry without disturbing some one within. After a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, I went up and begged her to tell me what was
the matter. She replied that her little girl was very ill
with low fever, and the doctor had told her that very evening
that he had scarcely any hope.</p>
<p>This woman was Lena&rsquo;s mother. I asked her to let me
see the child, whom I found flushed and restless, tossing
from side to side in her bed. Poor little Lena! The cottage
was near my own house, and I went every day after
that to see her. Often did I watch part of the night by
her sick bed while her mother rested. At length our little
patient began to recover; and while she was still too weak
to walk, she delighted to sit at the cottage door, and listen
while I told her stories.</p>
<p>Now, besides the poultry about the cottage, Lena had a
pair of white doves, and in one of my stories I had told her
of a letter being sent by a carrier-pigeon. Lena took it into
her head that one of her white doves should carry letters
from her to me after I returned to England. One day,
when she was almost well, I found her standing at the door
of the cottage, with the dove perched upon her hand, and
a letter tied round its neck. She had been trying if it
would carry a letter to me to my house close by; but it
had only wheeled round and round and come back again
to her. She said sadly: &ldquo;If it does not know how to take
a letter that little distance, how will it ever take one to
England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear simple Lena! she did not understand that pigeons
will only return to places where they have lived; but we
have managed to correspond without the help of carrier-pigeons.
I have seldom seen a prettier picture than she
presented that day, standing at the cottage door with the
white dove upon her hand.</p>

</div>
<p>Here we have a picture of Woodpeckers.
See how they cling to the bark of the
tree with their claws, and how eager
the two little ones seem for the prize
their mother has just captured. The
woodpecker is a bird of very singular
habits. It lives upon the insects which
exist in the bark of trees, and is remarkably
adapted by nature for obtaining this kind of food.
Its bill is long and sharp and powerful; and with its
hooked claws it clings to the tree while it sways its body
to and fro to give force to the strokes of its bill. The
object of these strokes is to shake the insects out of the
tree, and they are given with wonderful force and in rapid
succession. Then the bird thrusts its long tongue into the
crevices, and the tongue being barbed at the end and
covered with a sort of gum, it secures a vast number of insects
as well as their eggs.</p>
<p>In the quiet of the woods the sound of the woodpecker
tapping may be heard at a great distance. I remember
once, when I was a little girl, being very much frightened
by the noise: I will tell you how it happened.</p>
<p>The house where I lived in the country not only had a
large garden, but beyond that was a little wood, which we
called the shrubbery. This wood had a broad walk winding
through it, with seats placed here and there. One
beautiful summer morning I and my brother, who was
some years older than I was, were sitting together upon
one of these seats under the shade of the trees. He was
on his way to go out fishing, and was only stopping to do
something to his fishing tackle. Wanting a pair of
scissors, he sent me into the house to fetch them, ordering
me about in the sort of way in which big boys are apt to
order their little brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I soon returned with the scissors, but no longer found my
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
brother where I had left him. The truth is he had gone
off on his fishing expedition without waiting for my return.
However, I looked about for him, and presently I heard a
sound like somebody hitting a tree with a stick. &ldquo;Ah, ah,
so you are hiding, are you, Master Maurice?&rdquo; thought I;
and I looked behind different trees, one after another,
thinking every moment to discover him. Then I began to
fancy that the sound, although so clear and distinct, was
some distance off; so I wandered on, still following it, and
looking about as I went. Now and then the tapping
ceased, but always went on again after a minute.</p>
<p>At last I began to be frightened, and called out:&mdash;&ldquo;Maurice,
dear Maurice, where are you? You are
frightening me.&rdquo; The tapping ceased from that moment,
but my alarm did not. That such a noise should have
been made without anybody to make it seemed to me
very like something supernatural. I began to cry, and at
the same time set off running towards home. I dared not
look behind me as I ran, and when I reached the house,
was at first too frightened and excited even to explain what
was the matter. I must tell you that I was only seven
years old at that time.</p>
<p>I remember the old gardener said, when he heard the
story, that he suspected that it was only a woodpecker tapping;
but I refused to believe that a bird could make so
loud a noise. It was not till long afterwards, when I happened
to both hear and see one, that I became convinced
the old gardener was right.</p>
<p>The woodpecker is a handsome bird, about the size of a
pigeon, of a greenish colour, with black and white marks
upon the wings, and a crimson stain upon the head. It is
heard much oftener than seen, for, being very timid, it is
ingenious in hiding itself. It does not build a nest like
other birds, but seeks for a decayed place in the trunk of
some tree, where it scoops out a hole. There Mr. and
Mrs. Woodpecker establish their little home: there the
eggs are laid, and the young ones are reared.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">A PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.&mdash;THE HORSE IS STOLEN.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-172dt.jpg" alt="T" width="157" height="234" />
</div>
<p>The visit of Mr. de Malassise
and Eus&egrave;be only lasted two
days. Eus&egrave;be went away very
well satisfied with himself, for
in those two days he had contrived
to alarm his father
several times by putting himself
in a passion, and had
teazed his cousin so ingeniously
that he more than once
brought tears into his eyes.</p>
<p>The morning after the departure
of these unwelcome
visitors, Mr. de Roisel and Maurice started off on their
expedition to see Mr. Duberger, and to bring back the
horse. They were going two days later than was intended,
but a letter had been already sent to Mr. Duberger, explaining
why they were obliged to postpone their visit from
the twelfth of August to the fourteenth. That gentleman
did not live habitually at Paris, but at a place called
Palaiseau, which was not more than two or three hours&rsquo;
drive from Maurice&rsquo;s home. Mr. de Roisel drove Maurice
in a light chaise with one horse; and they started very
early, in order to avoid the heat of the day.</p>
<p>Palaiseau is a large straggling village situated in a pleasant
valley; and on the hills around are many pretty country
houses, one of which was inhabited by Mr. Duberger.
Neither Maurice nor his father had been there before, so,
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
on arriving in the village, they had to inquire which was
the house. Just in front of the little inn of the village
stood three or four men, conversing earnestly, and Mr. de
Roisel inquired of them for the house he wanted. One of
them replied:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good half mile beyond the village, sir; and
stands quite alone on the right hand side of the road. We
were just talking about a report there is in the village this
morning, that Mr. Duberger&rsquo;s house was broken into by
thieves last night; but the accounts are so different I
hardly know if any of them are true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. de Roisel touched his horse with the whip and hastened
on, feeling very anxious and alarmed. After driving
about half a mile along the road, he pulled up again to ask
his way of a woman who was standing at the door of a
cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to see Mr. Duberger?&rdquo; exclaimed the
good woman. &ldquo;Ah, poor dear man! Only to think there
are wretches in the world who would do him an injury! But
they do not belong to these parts, I&rsquo;m certain. He does
so much good, that no one here would hurt a hair of his
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! Has he been murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered! No, no: but he was robbed last night of a
great many valuable things. That&rsquo;s bad enough, I hope.
If you want to see him, sir, that&rsquo;s his house, yonder among
the trees. The turning there on the right leads directly
up to it.&rdquo; Saying this she pointed to a house, which,
seen from a distance, had a good appearance.</p>
<p>They turned up what might once have been a handsome
avenue of trees, but many had died or been cut down, and
never been replaced. A number of sheep were grazing
beneath the trees of the avenue, and there reigned over the
place that air of quiet and peace which brings repose both
to the eyes and heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img id="xxx13" src="images/i-174.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="802" />
<p class="pcap">SHE SAID, &ldquo;I WAS SURE YOU WOULD NOT BE READY.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Reaching the iron gate of the courtyard, Mr. de Roisel
got down to ring the bell, but finding that the gate was
not fastened he opened it, and the chaise drew up at the
stone steps of the entrance door. The house appeared
large, but very much out of repair. The walls were crumbling
in parts, and broken shutters hung at the windows;
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
but this appearance of decay or disorder seemed rather the
effect of negligence than of poverty.</p>
<p>They soon heard the sound of slow footsteps approaching
from the inside, and an old woman, having the look of
a housekeeper, appeared at the door. Glancing at our
travellers, she turned back into the house, and they could
hear her call out to some one within:&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the gentleman
who wrote to you the day before yesterday. I was
sure you would not be ready to receive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Marianne,&rdquo; replied a man&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
making all the haste I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the old woman, coming forward again, and
addressing Mr. de Roisel, making at the same time a
curtsey after the manner of a peasant, &ldquo;you are welcome.
If you will trouble yourself to walk into the drawing-room,
my master will join you there in an instant. Michel will
take the horse to the stable, sir. See, he&rsquo;s coming as
quickly as he can. He doesn&rsquo;t run very fast; his legs are
like mine&mdash;a little stiff. In truth, he&rsquo;s no longer young.
He has been our gardener, sir, for more than fifty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michel was a little withered old man, bent from age, and
from the habit of stooping at his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, in a shaking voice, &ldquo;excuse my slowness;
I have no longer the activity of a youth. Besides, I had a
good walk this morning to go after the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true then, this robbery I have heard of? What
has been stolen? Any money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, unfortunately,&rdquo; replied the old woman; &ldquo;if it
were only money my master would not care so much. He
thinks little about money&mdash;not enough, indeed. But the
thieves have carried away some precious and curious things
that never can be replaced. Still we ought to thank Providence
that we all remained fast asleep while the robbers
were in the house. If we had wakened up, perhaps they
would have cut our throats. But come in, I beg, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they entered the room, Marianne went on:&mdash;&ldquo;It
must be confessed that my master himself is partly to
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
blame for what has happened. He never would have the
doors fastened or the windows barred up. He trusts
everybody. But won&rsquo;t you sit down, sir?&rdquo; (Here she
put forward some chairs) &ldquo;You see we might all have been
murdered, sir. That would have mattered very little for
Michel and me; we are so old; but for him!&mdash;I tremble to
think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the old woman chattered away, Mr. de Roisel
looked round the room, but he saw nothing there to justify
the character which Mr. Duberger bore of being an
enlightened collector of curiosities and works of art, as well
as a man of science. The furniture was extremely old,
and of the fashion of fifty years ago. Some badly executed
drawings hung on the walls; and an old-fashioned clock
stood on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mr. de Roisel, observing it, &ldquo;can it be
past eleven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; replied Marianne; &ldquo;pardon me, it is not
yet ten. That clock is an excellent one, only if you do
not understand its ways, it is apt to mislead. The thieves
did not take anything from this room last night: they
seemed to know where the valuable things were to be found.
The furniture of this room, sir, my master sometimes says
would not sell for fifty francs altogether: still it is of value
to him&mdash;and to me also,&mdash;for it belonged to his grandmother,
my first mistress. This old furniture is associated
with the recollection of one we loved. These drawings
were made by her, and her husband had them framed as
you see. My master adored his grandmother, and these
old things are precious to him for her sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. de Roisel felt a strong sympathy for the man who
united such tenderness of heart with the rare intellect
which had made him celebrated. Maurice also was touched,
and took the withered hand of Marianne in his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good, my little gentleman; you remind
me of my master in his childhood.&rdquo; Then she went on:
&ldquo;After the death of my first mistress, I served the mother
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
of Mr. Duberger. She died too young to see the success
and honours of her son: I have never quitted my master
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. Duberger entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave us now, my good Marianne,&rdquo; said he. Then
embracing Maurice, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, how you have
grown! I think the good God watches over children that
have kind hearts. You have been growing up in happiness
and health, as a flower blossoms in the spring-time.&rdquo;
Then turning to Mr. de Roisel, he added: &ldquo;I received
your letter, sir, and regret very much indeed that the day
of your coming was postponed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear we have come at a very inconvenient time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not that; but you are one day too late.&rdquo;
Then taking Maurice on his knee, he went on: &ldquo;You are
a brave boy, and no doubt have deprived yourself of a good
deal in collecting these hundred francs; but they are useless
after all. When we met in the Luxembourg gardens,
I thought it better for you that your charity to the poor
woman should cost you some real sacrifice; but I was
wrong to take your horse in pledge for the money. Now
I am your debtor, and a debtor who cannot pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Maurice, as he burst into tears;
&ldquo;the thieves carried off Cressida last night. But it is not
your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, it is my fault. I was wanting in prudence;
I kept neither doors nor windows fastened. I am much to
blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. de Roisel; &ldquo;it has been
a chance which nobody could foresee. But do you not
think the thieves may yet be discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. I think they will betray themselves in
trying to sell the things they have stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope so,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. de Roisel.</p>
<p>With this hope, and the chance it afforded of the recovery
of the horse, Maurice tried to console himself.</p>

<p>Little Willie sits by the fire thinking. He
lives in this cottage alone with his mother, who
is out just now, and I will tell you what Willie
is thinking about so earnestly. He is a clever
good boy, and is making up his mind that he
ought to go out into the world and seek for work, and try
to earn his own living, instead of being dependent on his
mother, who is very poor. He determines he will tell her
so directly she comes in, and ask her leave to go.</p>

<p>Here is Willie, with his little bundle at his back, on
his first day&rsquo;s journey to seek his fortune. As he walks
along he is startled to observe a white cloud resting on the
ground, directly in his path. From this cloud come forth
two enormous hands, and a voice from the cloud says:&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be afraid, Willie; I come to be your friend. No
eyes but yours will be able to see me, but only persevere
in your wish to work, and I will be ever near to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie, somehow, does not feel frightened, but says:&mdash;&ldquo;Thank
you, good hands.&rdquo; And then they vanish.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene III.</span></h3>
<p>The help promised to Willie by the hands makes him so
happy that he runs and leaps with joy; but as evening
draws on he feels very tired. He lies down under some
trees, and eats some bread and cheese brought with him in
his wallet. He is in a forest now, and thinks he hears the
howling of wolves in the distance; still he is so tired that
he must go to sleep. Presently he sees the giant hands
spread themselves over him, forming a sort of tent. His
heart is full of gratitude as he says his prayers, and falls
asleep, feeling how safe he is beneath those giant hands.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene IV.</span></h3>
<p>The next day Willie obtains employment in the service
of a farmer. Here we see him in the corn-field reaping,
and doing as much work as two strong men could do.
But under the shelter of the high corn are the giant hands
at work helping him. Willie whistles and cuts away: his
sickle glistens as the corn falls under its long sweeps.</p>
<p>In the evening the farmer comes into the field, and
stares to see the long rows of well-tied sheaves. He looks
at Willie with astonishment, and promises himself that
he will do his best to keep so good a servant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>

</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Scene V.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;If he can reap so well, perhaps he can plough,&rdquo; says
the farmer to himself, as he leaves the cornfield; and the
next morning sees Willie employed as a ploughman. The
giant hands guide the plough, unseen by any but Willie; and
the land is ploughed in furrows as straight as the flight of
an arrow. The farmer watches from his window, and again
blesses his good fortune. As time goes on, he feels grateful
to the industrious lad, who seems to take pleasure in
working for him; and gradually Willie is placed over the
other labourers and trusted with everything.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene VI.</span></h3>
<p>One day, while the sheep are out on the hills, a heavy
storm comes on, and the low ground between the hills is
quickly flooded. Willie goes out to bring in his master&rsquo;s
sheep, but by the time he has collected them, the water is
pouring on like a river in a narrow valley which separates
them from the farm. &ldquo;How I wish the hands would help
me now!&rdquo; thinks Willie. In a moment the giant hands
spread themselves over the turbid water, forming a bridge.
He drives the sheep across, and reaches the farm in
safety, to the joy of all, for they have given him up for lost.</p>

</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Scene VII.</span></h3>
<p>One night Willie is wakened up by a cry of &ldquo;Fire!
Fire!&rdquo; He dresses in a moment, and rushes out into the
farmyard. Here he finds his master and the farm-servants
running about, frantic with terror; pigs are squealing, geese
cackling, everybody is shouting, but there is no water
handy. The flames are making their way from room to
room, and now reach the chamber of the farmer&rsquo;s pretty
daughter. She is still there; what is to be done? The
staircase is burnt; no ladder will reach the window; and
there stands the girl, in the midst of the smoke, screaming,
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
and stretching out her arms for help. Willie looks on in despair.
Suddenly the giant hands appear to him, and placing
themselves against the side of the house, form a ladder
with their fingers, up which he quickly springs. He
catches the girl in his arms, and in a moment brings her
down, safe and sound, to her weeping father.</p>
<p class="tb">Now I daresay my little readers have been sufficiently
interested in these seven scenes in the life of Willie to wish
to know what became of him. Well then, Willie had such
good wages that he was able to send money to his mother,
and as soon as he grew to be quite a man, he married the
farmer&rsquo;s pretty daughter, whose life he had saved. Everybody
liked him, and he soon took the entire management
of the farm.</p>
<p>But now do you know the meaning of these giant hands?
They signify the strength and power arising from industry,

<p>I am sure you would like to hear about an
old horse that belonged to my papa when
I was a little girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Tom had been so handsome when he was young,
and thought so much of, that my father kept him
long after he was past work. Tom used to lead a
very happy life of it in a nice large field, where he
had plenty to eat all the summer-day, and no work
to do. But there was no pond in this field, only a
pump, with a large tub to hold the water; and one
of the men used to fill it every day for old
Tom.</p>
<p>However, one day, when hay-making was going
on, there was a great deal to do for all hands about
the place, and Bob the odd man, whose work it was
to give old Tom water, was busy helping cart the
hay. So when the old horse felt thirsty, and went
to his tub for water, he found it empty. He gave a
great neigh, and a stamp with his foot; but finding
that nobody came, he thought he would help himself,
and fell to pumping water into the tub for
himself, as you see him in the picture.</p>

<h2 id="c60">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>RAISING OF THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-192dt.jpg" alt="T" width="96" height="224" />
</div>
<p>The next miracle I have to tell you of,
my dear children, is one which shows
particularly our Lord&rsquo;s divine quality
of mercy. It is called &ldquo;the raising
of the daughter of Jairus,&rdquo; which
means&mdash;restoring her to life.</p>
<p>Our Saviour was one day at the
house of His disciple Matthew at
Capernaum, when a man of importance
in the city, a ruler in the synagogue,
named Jairus, came to Him. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
man had an only child, a daughter about twelve years old,
who was lying at the point of death; and he came to Jesus
in the hope that He would cure her.</p>
<p>Generally, the poor and lowly were the first to believe
in our Saviour. The rich were slow to accept the self-denying
doctrines which He taught; the learned were too
wise in their own esteem to listen to His instruction.
But when they were in affliction both the rich and the
learned sometimes came to Jesus to seek His aid. So it
was in this instance.</p>
<p>We may imagine what the unhappy father suffered at
the prospect of losing his darling child,&mdash;at the thought of
her fading away from him, and sinking into the grave.
As he was rich, we may suppose that all had been done
by the doctors that could be done; so now in an agony of
despair he turned to seek our Saviour. No doubt he
thought of all the miraculous cures Jesus had effected, as
he went towards Matthew&rsquo;s house, where he found our
Saviour at the door teaching a crowd of people. Jairus
immediately fell at His feet, and with heart-felt earnestness
&ldquo;besought him greatly&rdquo; that He would come and
see his child.</p>
<p>Jesus rose, and went forth, followed by a number of
people, while Jairus led the way to his own house. The
poor father would have walked quickly, every moment
seeming an age till he reached his sick child&rsquo;s bedside,
but the crowd pressing round, interfered with their speed,
and soon there arose another cause of delay.</p>
<p>In the crowd was a poor woman who had been very ill
for a long time. She had consulted many doctors, but
none could cure her; and at last she had spent all her
money in trying to regain her health. Hearing that Jesus
was near, she approached Him in great fear and trembling.
She was almost crushed by the crowd, as she struggled to
come near Him; but at length succeeded so far as to be
able to stretch forth her hand, and touch the border of His
mantle. In a moment she felt that she was recovering
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
from her illness. Our Saviour stopped, and turned
towards her, when she cast herself at His feet, fearing for
her presumption. But He looked graciously upon her,
for He knew why she had touched His garment; then
speaking to her, He said:&mdash;&ldquo;Daughter, be of good comfort;
thy faith hath made thee whole.&rdquo; And from that hour she
was cured.</p>
<p>After this incident, Jairus was again hurrying on,
leading the way to his house, when messengers met him
with the agonizing intelligence that the child was already
dead&mdash;gone beyond the reach of human help. Thereupon
Christ turned to Jairus, saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Be not afraid; only
believe, and she shall be made whole.&rdquo; For it was as
easy to Him to bring back the dead, as to restore the
living.</p>
<p>He went into the house with three of His disciples and
the parents of the child. Then He addressed words of
comfort to the father and mother, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;The damsel
is not dead but sleepeth;&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that her death would
only be like a short sleep, because He was going to bring
her back to life.</p>
<p>Then taking hold of the little girl&rsquo;s hand, as though He
were about to waken her from a pleasant sleep, He said:
&ldquo;Talitha cumi!&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;Damsel, arise!&rdquo; The words
were no sooner spoken, than the colour returned to her
cheeks, her eyes opened, and she arose as if just awakened
from a refreshing sleep.</p>
<p>We are told that &ldquo;the parents and all present were
astonished with a great astonishment.&rdquo; We may also
suppose how great was their delight, and how unbounded
was their gratitude to our blessed Lord.</p>

<h2 id="c61">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3>ALEC AND ELFIE.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-196di.jpg" alt="I" width="78" height="113" />
</div>
<p>In giving you an account of Alec, one of my
little boy friends, I must give you at the
same time an account of Elfie, one of my little
dog friends, for the two are inseparable.
Both these friends of mine are Scotch; and
I met them first when the little boy was yet
in petticoats, and the doggie a tiny little
puppy that had just left its mother.</p>
<p>The two young things grew up together, Elfie, the dog,
becoming every day more of a companion for Alec, the
boy. But the dog grew old the fastest, and when the
event I am going to tell you of occurred, Alec was about
nine years old and Elfie about seven; which is in fact quite
old for a dog, and an age at which he is likely to be as wise
as ever he will be.</p>
<p>Alec had no brother, but he had a cousin at whose house
he used to spend a good deal of his time. Little Arthur was
about four years younger than Alec, and would follow him
about like his shadow, looking up to his big cousin as an
authority on all matters. He learnt from Alec to consider
Elfie the most wonderful dog in the world, with more
sense than most people. He thought Elfie understood
everything that was said to him, and could do almost
everything he was told to do. Many an hour the three
would spend together; and Alec and Arthur never appeared
tired of seeing Elfie go through the common dog&rsquo;s trick
with a piece of sugar on his nose. When the word
&ldquo;Trust&rdquo; was said to him, he let the sugar remain on the
tip of his nose, while he only squinted at it with all his
might. Directly he heard the words &ldquo;Paid for&rdquo; he
would jerk it into the air, and snap it up as it fell. This
is how the three are amusing themselves, you see, in
the picture.</p>
<p>One morning when it was very hot, Arthur&rsquo;s mamma
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
and I were sitting under the shade of some trees in the garden,
working and reading. We knew that little Arthur
was about somewhere in the garden or the grounds with
his cousin Alec, who, we thought, was old enough to keep
the little one out of harm&rsquo;s way. Suddenly we heard a
sound of panting and puffing, and saw Elfie tearing across
the garden towards us. With his short legs and long hair
he appeared as if he was rolling over the ground: his little
red tongue was hanging out of his mouth, and we could
see his bright eyes gleaming with excitement through the
overhanging locks of hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be the matter with the dog?&rdquo; exclaimed
Arthur&rsquo;s mamma, jumping up. &ldquo;Has he gone mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Elfie began barking furiously, and seizing
her dress in his mouth, tried to drag her away. A thought
struck me, and I cried out,&mdash;&ldquo;Something is wrong with
the boys, and Elfie has come to let us know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the direction Elfie had come from, but hidden from
our view by trees, was a large piece of water: towards this
we hastened. Fortunately Arthur&rsquo;s papa was sitting in the
library, of which the window was open: we called to him
as we ran, and he followed as fast as he could. Coming
in sight of the water, our worst fears were realized. Only
a few yards from the bank, but in quite deep water, we
beheld the canoe floating bottom upwards, and the two
boys clinging to it; or rather, Alec clinging to the canoe
with one arm, and with the other supporting Arthur, who
had fainted.</p>
<p>The father plunged in instantly, and in a moment
brought Arthur to shore, and placed him in his mother&rsquo;s
arms. Alec, left alone, easily supported himself by the
canoe till his uncle returned, and brought him also on to
the bank. The fault was Alec&rsquo;s, who had taken out the
canoe from the boat-house without permission; but what
praise could be too great for Elfie, who had probably saved
two lives by his intelligence? We all agreed he was the
most wonderful doggie in the world.</p>

<h2 id="c62">A STORY OF A WOODEN HORSE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">EUS&Egrave;BE AT PARIS.&mdash;HOW HE BECOMES THE OWNER OF CRESSIDA.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-200dt.jpg" alt="T" width="69" height="148" />
</div>
<p>The course of my story obliges me now to follow
the doings of Maurice&rsquo;s cousin Eus&egrave;be
through one chapter. His goat Jeanne had
died some time ago; to her had succeeded a
monkey, then a dog; afterwards some birds,
and last of all a lamb. With his usual
caprice these had all been discarded in turn,
and he had at this moment no animal to pet
or to torment. It was a hot day towards the
end of August, and Eus&egrave;be lounged about in
one easy chair after another, trying in vain to occupy or
amuse himself. Suddenly, the idea occurred to him that
he would like to pass a few days in Paris.</p>
<p>Now Mr. and Mrs. de Malassise were just thinking of
going to stay for a few weeks at Dieppe, which was a place
more suitable certainly for the hot weather than Paris.
But Eus&egrave;be had taken a fancy to Paris; and to gain his
point, he acted the little comedy which always succeeded
so well with his parents: he screamed, and rolled over and
over on the ground like a mad child. They were frightened,
and started off with him the very next morning, leaving
the shady woods of Malassise for the dust of the Boulevard
des Italiens, where they usually lodged when they came to
Paris.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of their arrival, Eus&egrave;be asked his
father to take him for a walk as far as the square of the
Bastille. He had heard that street-jugglers often performed
their tricks there: and, hot as it was, he insisted
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
that his mamma, a delicate weak little woman, should walk
with them.</p>
<p>They had walked as far as the gate of St. Denis, when
a man approached them, who had some little watches for
sale fit for children. He went up to Eus&egrave;be, who, although
such a big boy, was not above stopping to look at the glittering
watches with their bright chains attached. Then
the man said in a low voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to buy a beautiful horse, my
prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This title of prince was pleasant to the ears of Eus&egrave;be,
and with an air of kind protection, he replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you ask, my good fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask if your lordship feels disposed to make the purchase
of an extraordinary and beautiful wooden horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have rocking-horses of all sorts and sizes,&rdquo; rejoined
Eus&egrave;be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it not, your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This title of highness completed the work of turning the
little boy&rsquo;s head; and putting on the air of being a very
great person, he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you seem to know who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, who does not know your lordship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now of course this cunning fellow did not really suppose
that Eus&egrave;be was either a prince or a lord, but saw very
well that he was a spoilt child, and thought it would be
a good opportunity for selling Cressida&mdash;for Cressida it was
that he was offering,&mdash;and he dared not sell it publicly.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. de Malassise, who had walked on a little
in front, now stopped, and the former called out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the man, when he came up to them, &ldquo;I
have a beautiful wooden horse to sell, which walks and
moves about like a real horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off!&rdquo; said Mr. de Malassise, who did not like the
look of the man; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you just come and see it, noble sir? it is at
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
my house, only two steps from here. It has the movements
of a live horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you need not buy it, sir, if you would only come
to see it. It is an extraordinary horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, I want to see it,&rdquo; said Eus&egrave;be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my dear,&rdquo; urged his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, I <i>will</i> go to see the horse,&rdquo; and Eus&egrave;be began
to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why oppose him, my dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. de Malassise,
&ldquo;as he is so anxious to see the horse. Suppose he should
have an attack of the nerves out here! what should we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you hear, papa; why do you oppose me? I&rsquo;m
going to have an attack of the nerves, I feel I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us go and see the horse then, pray,&rdquo; said Mr.
de Malassise, resigning himself with rather a bad grace.</p>
<p>They had followed their guide for about a quarter of a
mile, when an empty hackney-coach passed. The man
stopped it, saying, &ldquo;Perhaps, sir, the lady will be tired if
she walks all the way; had you not better take this
hackney-coach? I will get up on the box, and direct
the driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you said it was only two steps,&rdquo; urged Mr. de
Malassise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not far,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let us have the coach; I can&rsquo;t walk any
more,&rdquo; exclaimed Eus&egrave;be.</p>
<p>So of course they got into the hackney-coach, while the
man who had the horse to sell seated himself beside the
coachman. On they went, right out of Paris, into the
narrow streets of a suburb inhabited by very poor people.
On they went still, while the houses became more scattered,
and the roads were so bad that the horses could hardly get
along.</p>
<p>At last the coachman pulled up, and taking out his pipe,
he began to light it, as he said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go no further;
the patience of a hackney-coachman has its limits, these
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
roads ain&rsquo;t fit for any carriage, and the sun&rsquo;s hot enough
to kill a camel of the desert, much more horses like mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img id="xxx14" src="images/i-203.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="798" />
<p class="pcap">&ldquo;THE HORSES COULD HARDLY GET ALONG.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. de Malassise had lost patience also, and called out
to their guide in an angry voice, &ldquo;Now, my man, tell me
at once, where are you leading us to?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;My noble gentleman,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;do not be
angry; I did not think it was so far, but you can see the
house now; and, if the lady will get down from the carriage,
we can reach it on foot in two minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. de Malassise looked out of the carriage window
on one side, and his wife on the other. They saw a few
scattered houses of the meanest description, and began to
view their position with dismay; but Eus&egrave;be found it an
amusing adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we were in Sicily, and then
we might be attacked by brigands in such an out-of-the-way
place as this. I read about them in that little book
you gave me yesterday, you know, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this remark Eus&egrave;be&rsquo;s mother began to laugh as if it
were very funny and brilliant; even his father was almost
restored to good humour by it. And when Eus&egrave;be added&mdash;&ldquo;only,
neither that man nor the coachman are as handsome
as brigands&rdquo;&mdash;the father and mother exchanged
looks of congratulation at the wit and humour of their
son.</p>
<p>They walked a short distance along the dirty, badly-paved
street, and entered a small low house almost in
ruins. You may imagine how well it was furnished, when
I tell you that Mrs. de Malassise was obliged to stand,
because the master of the house&mdash;that is, the man who
conducted them&mdash;had but one chair to offer her, and that
was lame of two of its legs. He opened a large closet,
the door of which was concealed, appearing only like a
panel in the wall, and he led forth a pretty little black
horse, scarcely bigger than a large dog;&mdash;but I need not
describe Cressida a second time to my young readers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img id="xxx15" src="images/i-205.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">&ldquo;HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS HORSE?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Now although Eus&egrave;be had often had Cressida described
to him by Maurice, he had never happened to see the little
horse; consequently he did not recognise it on the present
occasion; nor had he ever imagined Cressida to be so
wonderful as he found this horse to be. He had no sooner
seated himself in the saddle than the pressure of his knees
against the sides of the horse caused the legs to move, and
it walked round the room. Then, when Eus&egrave;be in his
delight very naturally began to pat it on the neck, this
had the effect of causing the little horse to neigh
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
joyfully, just like a real pony. Eus&egrave;be&rsquo;s father and mother
were as much astonished and delighted as he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come by this horse?&rdquo; inquired Mr. de
Malassise, in a voice which sufficiently showed the suspicions
he entertained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was given to me by a friend of mine,&rdquo; replied the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a generous friend. And how much do you
ask for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty francs, though I know it is worth a great deal
more.&rdquo; Then seeing that the small price he asked had
only made his customer more suspicious, he went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble gentleman, I will tell you the truth. Formerly
I was rich, and sold toys in a shop on the Boulevard;
but misfortunes came upon me, I had to give up my business,
and of all the beautiful things I had, this wooden
horse is the only one I kept. I kept it for my children to
play with; but, alas! noble sir, it has pleased heaven to
take them away from me. Ah, my children! my children!
they resembled your beautiful son. I would have kept this
horse always in remembrance of them, but hunger, sir&mdash;hunger
compels me to sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dried his eyes with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said Mrs. de Malassise, much touched.
Then she whispered to her husband, &ldquo;My dear, I would
give him twenty francs, and leave him the horse he is so
fond of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no reason for giving him twenty francs, and <i>I</i>
think we should be wise to have nothing to do with the
horse either. I suspect it&rsquo;s a matter which the police will
have something to do with sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a hard heart you have! and how suspicious
you are!&rdquo; rejoined the wife. &ldquo;I am sure the poor man is
truthful. Just look at his despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was sitting on the ground, hiding his face with
his hands. He seemed to have partly heard the whispered
conversation, and said, &ldquo;Her ladyship is an angel of
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
charity, but I should not regret parting with the horse
when I knew it would be in the hands of such a good
young gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eus&egrave;be at last put an end to the hesitation of his parents
in a very simple way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you buy the horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;let us go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; cried Eus&egrave;be, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go away from here till
you buy the horse.&rdquo; And he began to tear his hair, and
stamp on the ground, uttering piercing shrieks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the horse! I want the horse!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble gentleman,&rdquo; urged the man, &ldquo;what are
eighty francs to you? When I was rich I would have
given more to spare my children&rsquo;s tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear! I feel that I am going to fall,&rdquo;
cried Eus&egrave;be, turning round and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, calm yourself, my child,&rdquo; cried his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eus&egrave;be, my dear boy,&rdquo; said his father kindly, &ldquo;I will
give you another horse. You shall have the most expensive
that can be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want this one; I want this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you shall have it&mdash;there; only don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want it directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it directly. We will take it away with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eus&egrave;be became calm as if by enchantment. He had
not really shed a tear, but his eyes were red from being
rubbed, and his hair was pushed up in indescribable disorder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, kiss me,&rdquo; said his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa; but do you know that twice to-day I have
very nearly had an attack of nerves through your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matters being thus comfortably arranged at last, the
eighty francs were paid, the horse was put into the coach,
and they all returned to the Boulevard des Italiens. Here
Eus&egrave;be amused himself the whole evening by riding his
pretty little horse round and round the drawing-room.</p>

<h2 id="c64">SCENES IN THE LIFE OF MR. LOVESPORT.</h2>
<h3><span class="sc">Scene I.</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Lovesport has left his native land in search of larger
game, and more adventurous and dangerous sport than he
can find in England. One day in southern Africa he has
cautiously approached a herd of antelopes, and is just
within the distance for a shot, when he observes a sudden
commotion among them, some bounding one way, some
another, as if in terror. Looking round to discover the
cause, he finds himself face to face with an enormous lion.
The lion pauses to consider whether he will have an antelope
for dinner or Mr. Lovesport. Our intrepid hunter
takes advantage of the pause to shoot him through the heart.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene II.</span></h3>
<p>This is the way Mr. Lovesport once rode a Quagga. It
is a kind of zebra, or wild ass, and is considered untameable.
A friend of Mr. Lovesport&mdash;a colonist in southern
Africa&mdash;had caught one, and had tried in vain to tame it.
Our hunter offered to ride it, if they could put on saddle
and bridle. This was at length accomplished: he mounted,
and the quagga galloped away, away till he reached a herd
of his own species, who all came round, curious to know
what thing he had upon his back. Our hero became
anxious to return, and, taking off his jacket, contrived to
wrap it over the eyes of the beast; then once getting its
head in the right direction, spurred it on, till it stopped
exhausted at his friend&rsquo;s door.</p>

</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Scene III.</span></h3>
<p>In one of his hunting expeditions, Mr. Lovesport finds
an elephant asleep under some trees. He has only one
attendant with him, a negro, named Jumbo; and this man
takes it into his head that he will tie the elephant&rsquo;s leg to
a tree with some strong rope he has, while it sleeps: and
see what it will do when it wakes up. He had just finished
his work when the huge creature awoke. In a moment the
rope was snapped, but unluckily Jumbo was entangled in
it, and remained for a moment attached to the elephant&rsquo;s
leg, which he had to cling to that it might not step on
him. In this way he was carried some distance, though
without being seriously hurt. Our hunter did not fire at
the elephant, lest, becoming furious, it might crush the
little creature clinging to it.</p>

</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Scene IV.</span></h3>
<p>This is a scene where our hunter was a looker-on, not
an actor. He was on one of his expeditions with Jumbo,
when they heard the trumpeting sound made by an elephant
when angry. Looking through the trees, they saw
a huge creature stamping with his feet, and tearing up the
grass with his trunk. Presently a rhinoceros approached,
as if the two had appointed to meet and fight upon that
spot. The battle did not last long. The poor elephant
could not guard the under part of its body from its
enemy&rsquo;s horn; and it fled away, perhaps mortally
wounded, leaving a stream of blood upon its path. This
is the last scene for to-day of Mr. Lovesport&rsquo;s adventures,
but perhaps he will send some more another time.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-217dt.jpg" alt="H" width="102" height="117" />
</div>
<p>The picture on the opposite page shows
us a family of hares enjoying themselves
in a field of cabbages. How
pretty, and yet how queer-looking they
are! I think that one standing up in
the middle, with his ears so straight up,
must be Mr. Hare, while the others are
Mrs. Hare and the children. They are
eating away as fast as they can, while the good papa looks
on, and listens with those long ears of his for the sound of
any approaching footsteps. If he hears any noise of a
kind which he considers alarming, he will give notice to
his wife and little ones; then they will all scurry off so
fast that they will soon be miles away from the spot where
they have been frightened.</p>
<p>A hare never walks or trots, because the hind legs are
so much longer than the front ones, but it goes along in
a succession of bounds. Hares can take great leaps, too,
in height as well as in distance: they have been known,
when pursued, to jump over very high hedges, and even
walls of moderate size. One curious quality in a hare is
that it never becomes fat, however rich the pasture may
be on which it feeds; consequently it can go very long
distances without fatigue.</p>
<p>Though rabbits are easily domesticated, it is very unusual
to see a really tame hare; and you will be surprised
to hear that the only one I ever met with was in a house
in London. I went one day to call upon a gentleman&mdash;an
artist&mdash;who was very fond of animals: indeed, among
other things, he often painted animals. I found him in
his studio, working away at his picture, with three dogs
and a cat and her kittens all in the room with him. I sat
for some time talking and admiring his picture, when presently
I heard an odd sort of knocking or rubbing at the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hear some one at the door,&rdquo; said I, after the noise
had been going on for some time, thinking my friend did
not hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only stupid old Tommy; he is such a
bother; he never seems able to settle anywhere now he&rsquo;s
so old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; I asked, thinking he was speaking of
some stupid old person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see him?&rdquo; said the artist; &ldquo;he is
not particularly handsome now, and he is dreadfully impudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking to the door he opened it, and who should come
hopping and leaping into the room but a gigantic hare.
He hopped past me first, and then turning round, came
quite close, and stood up on his hind legs. He made one
long ear stick forward and the other backward, looking
more comical than I can tell you; and he twisted his
curious, sensitive, moveable nose round and round, while
he stared at me with his immense prominent eyes till I
thought they were going to drop out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t manners, Tommy,&rdquo; said my friend; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
very rude to stare so: lie down.&rdquo; Whereupon good
obedient Tommy crouched down, with his nose between
his two front paws; laid his ears back flat on his neck,
and did his best, I am sure, not to stare&mdash;but that he could
not help, by reason of the peculiar nature of his eyes.</p>
<p>I caressed him, and found him as tame and gentle as a
little dog. Indeed my friend had had him from the time
he was a very tiny creature.</p>

<p>A Fox once fell into a deep well, and could

drink, came to the well, and seeing the
Fox, asked him if the water was good. The
Fox did not say he had fallen into the well, but
pretended he stayed in the well from choice; and
saying the water was the best he had ever tasted,
begged the Goat to jump down and try it. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
Goat jumped down, and drank; and then sly Fox
told him that they were imprisoned in the well.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we may still get out if you will
place your fore-feet upon the wall; I will then run
up your back and escape, and help you out afterwards.&rdquo;
The Goat did as the Fox asked, and
Mr. Fox, running up his back, soon got out of the
well, and then ran off. The Goat called after him,
when the Fox, turning round, cried out these
words:&mdash;&ldquo;You foolish old fellow! If you had as
many brains in your head as you have hairs in
your beard you would have looked before you
leaped.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c70">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>THE TWO BLIND MEN RESTORED TO SIGHT.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-224dt.jpg" alt="T" width="97" height="223" />
</div>
<p>The next miracle that I shall tell you
about, my dear children, is one which
is represented in the picture above; it
is our Saviour giving sight to two blind
men.</p>
<p>When He left the house of Jairus,
the ruler, whose daughter He had raised
from the dead, the scripture tells us
that two blind men followed Him. As
they followed, they kept crying out,
&ldquo;Thou son of David, have mercy upon
us!&rdquo; They meant by this entreaty to
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
implore Christ to have pity upon their darkness and
misery; to consider how helpless and useless they were;
and, as He had just restored to life a child already dead,
to have mercy upon them, and give them back their sight.</p>
<p>It is evident that these men thoroughly believed our
Saviour to be the true Messiah, whose coming had been
foretold by the prophets; for one of the signs by which
the true Messiah was to be known, according to the prophecies,
was His giving sight to the blind.</p>
<p>Our Saviour at first, as though to try the faith of these two
poor men, appeared not to regard them. But they followed
Him into the house where He was going, groping their
way as they best could, and repeated their prayer, &ldquo;Oh,
son of David, have mercy on us!&rdquo; Then Jesus, as St.
Matthew tells, said unto them, &ldquo;Believe ye that I am
able to do this?&rdquo; and they replied, &ldquo;Yea, Lord.&rdquo; Then
He touched their eyes, saying, &ldquo;According to your faith
be it done unto you.&rdquo; And their eyes were opened.</p>
<p>We may observe that Christ appeared to make faith a
condition upon which the success of the miracle was to
depend, and it is evident that these poor men had perfect
faith. What unspeakable joy and gratitude they must
have felt on finding their dark night suddenly changed
into bright day. Without pain, without any operation,
simply by the touch of Christ upon their sightless eyes,
had one of the greatest of earthly blessings been given to
these two men.</p>
<p>There is another miracle I shall have time to tell you
about to-day, my children, which was performed soon
after the last. It consisted in the feeding of a multitude
of people&mdash;five thousand&mdash;upon five barley loaves and two
small fishes. It took place on the shore of the sea of
Galilee.</p>
<p>A great multitude of people had followed our Saviour
to listen to His teaching, and He had led them some distance
away from any town. He preached to them a long
time, and was still continuing His instructions when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
shades of evening began to gather round. Then the disciples
reminded Him that the day was declining, one of
them saying, &ldquo;This is a desert place, and now the time is
far passed: send them away that they may go into the
country round about and buy themselves bread, for they
have nothing to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But our Saviour was too compassionate to send the
people away hungry, and He intended Himself to give
them food. He said to His disciples, &ldquo;How many loaves
have ye? go and see.&rdquo; And when they knew, they said,
&ldquo;Five loaves and two fishes.&rdquo; Christ then commanded
them to make all the people sit down upon the grass; He
took the five loaves and the two fishes, and brake the
loaves, and gave the pieces to His disciples to give among
the people: He also divided the two fishes, and gave them
in the same way. Then the multitude, as the Bible tells
us, ate and were filled: and, what is more, the disciples
afterwards gathered up several basketsful of the fragments
that were left.</p>
<p>Thus, by our Lord&rsquo;s power, those five loaves and two
fishes were made sufficient to feed and satisfy that great
multitude of five thousand people.</p>

readers. Dora is an only child, and a very
spoilt one too,&mdash;though I ought to mention
that I think she is improving of late; and
her improvement dates from the event I
am going to describe. It was a severe
lesson for her, but I hope and believe it will prove a useful
one.</p>
<p>Dora had a very naughty and stupid habit, whenever
she was found fault with, of saying she would run away.
One day, when the family were staying at Hastings, nurse
scolded her for drawing upon her books, and threatened
to tell mamma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to draw upon my books, and I will!&rdquo; replied
Dora; &ldquo;and if mamma scolds me I shall run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined nurse, losing patience for once, as she
afterwards confessed, &ldquo;and it would be real kindness to us
all, miss Dora, if you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Dora walked out of the nursery, highly
offended.</p>
<p>A little while afterwards mamma asked for Dora to go
out with her on to the sands. The child was nowhere to
be found. Nurse supposed her to have gone into the
drawing-room: mamma thought her still in the nursery.
The house was searched in vain. Then nurse remembered
the conversation which had taken place:&mdash;Dora had really
run away!</p>
<p>The alarm and distress of the father and mother were
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
beyond description. The child was only seven years old:
what could have become of her? Servants were sent out
in all directions&mdash;on to the sands; to the pier; into the
streets: but she was nowhere to be found. Then nurse
had a happy idea. You must know that in many country
towns like Hastings, an old custom is kept up of having a
Town-crier. When people lose anything, like a watch, a
purse, or a dog, they employ this man. He goes about
the town ringing a bell to attract attention, and then reads
from a piece of paper, in a loud voice, a description of the
thing lost; offering a reward for its discovery.</p>
<p>Nurse very sensibly thought a lost child might be cried
about the town as well as anything else; and a handsome
reward was offered for the recovery of this naughty little
girl.</p>
<p>But what had become of Dora in the meantime? She
had run out of the house suddenly in her fit of anger,
carrying her doll in her arms, but without hat or jacket.
At first she was delighted to find herself alone and free in
the streets, and laughed as she thought how frightened
nurse would be. But after walking for a little while, she
discovered that she had lost herself: for she had only been
at Hastings two or three days, and did not even know the
name of the street she lived in. She had hoped to frighten
nurse, but never thought of being frightened herself; yet
that was what it had come to.</p>
<p>She sat upon a doorstep and began to cry. Presently
somebody spoke to her. Then Dora thought of stories she
had heard of children being stolen, and started up and ran
away. So she wandered about for two or three hours, till
at last the Town-crier came close to where she stood in a
doorway. She heard him read the description of herself,
and the people standing by recognised it also. The
crier had a kind face; she let him take her by the hand,
and thus was led home again, followed by a crowd of
children.</p>

</div>
<p>For the subject of our natural history picture
to-day we have some Grouse. There
is a nice little family of grouse, consisting
of papa, mamma, and four children, all
taking a pleasant walk among the heath
and fern. At the same time the old birds
are searching for the wild berries, the buds
of the heath, and the seeds which form their
principal food. Look how eager the young ones are to
have their share of some nice berries, which mamma
grouse has just found!</p>
<p>These birds are only met with on moors or wild heaths,
and chiefly in mountainous countries; indeed Scotland is
the country where they are now principally found, and
people often go there on purpose for the grouse-shooting.
I daresay some of my little readers already know that
grouse-shooting begins on the 12th of August, a great
day for sportsmen. From the way in which game is now
preserved in England, partridge-shooting has come to be
a tamer sport than it used to be. Many brace of partridges
may sometimes be brought down during a short
walk over cultivated fields, and such sport seems less manly
than taking long fatiguing walks over breezy moors, as
sportsmen have to do in search of grouse.</p>
<p>The grouse is a very wild and shy bird, and both skill
and caution are required in approaching them; they live in
flocks, called &ldquo;packs,&rdquo; and form their nests, as partridges
do, upon the ground. Their plumage is a rich brown,
mottled with paler spots; the tail is black, with the exception
of four of the feathers, which have red marks on them:
over the eye also is a rough bare red spot. The bill of
the grouse is short, arched, and very strong; and the legs
of this bird, as the winter approaches, become feathered.
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
As an article of food, the grouse is very delicate, and has
an excellent flavour.</p>
<p>The bird I have been describing is the red grouse; that
is in fact the common grouse. But there is also found in
Scotland, though less frequently, the black grouse, which
is a much larger bird. The red grouse is rather bigger
than a partridge.</p>
<p>I once made the acquaintance of a tame grouse&mdash;one at
least that had been domesticated. The gentleman it belonged
to had picked it up out of its nest when a tiny thing
on the moors in Scotland; and being a great bird-fancier,
and having a collection, he had brought it in a cage to his
house in Kent. When I saw Peter&mdash;that was the name
given the grouse,&mdash;he was quite tame, but very ill-tempered.
You might take him up if you pleased, but he
always pecked the hand that did so. Peter was supposed
to live habitually in a wicker cage, but in truth he had
pretty well the run of the house. More than once he had
taken flight beyond the premises, but had returned for his
food. One day however he was missed, and never came
back. His fate may be surmised from the fact that about
the same time a party of gentlemen in the neighbourhood,
being out shooting&mdash;it was September&mdash;were surprised to
find a grouse among the game they had killed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">HOW EUS&Egrave;BE TREATS THE HORSE AT DIEPPE.&mdash;MAURICE RECOVERS IT.&mdash;THE THIEVES ARE ARRESTED.&mdash;RETURN OF FRITZ.&mdash;HIS GRATITUDE TO MAURICE.&mdash;HE MENDS THE HORSE.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-235da.jpg" alt="A" width="82" height="114" />
</div>
<p>A few days after Eus&egrave;be came into possession
of the horse, in the way described in the
last chapter, he went off with his father and
mother to Dieppe for sea-bathing. He
took Cressida with him, for he wished to
show it to some little friends whom he expected
to meet there.</p>
<p>His fondness for the wooden horse did not last long.
Instead of being reasonable and gentle with it, like Maurice,
he was continually wanting this ingenious automaton
to do more than it was intended to do. When it failed, he
would grow impatient, call it obstinate, and beat it with all
his might; sometimes he would spitefully pull the hair from
its mane, and try to tear out its eyes. The best that could
happen for the poor little horse now would be for its master
to get tired of it, and cast it aside entirely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img id="xxx16" src="images/i-236.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="770" />
<p class="pcap">THE RECOIL OF THE PISTOL THREW HIM ON HIS BACK.</p>
</div>
<p>The garden of the house occupied by Mr. and Mrs. de
Malassise at Dieppe was ornamented with grottoes, rocks,
cascades, rivulets, all in miniature, as if intended to amuse
children. Eus&egrave;be was fond of jumping about among the
rocks and rivulets, and one day he took it into his head
that Cressida should do the same. He took the horse at a
gallop up to a little stream, only two or three feet wide,
intending it to leap across; but it galloped into the water
instead, leaping not being one of the movements it was
constructed to make. Eus&egrave;be took it up to the water two
or three times, not sparing threats or blows while he did
so, but in vain. Then he began to scream, as usual when
he was in a rage, and looking about for some means of
satisfying his anger, he remembered that his father kept a
loaded pistol on the upper shelf of a closet in his dressing-room.
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
He ran upstairs, and by mounting on a chair, contrived
to reach the pistol, which was a double-barrelled one.
Returning again into the garden, and still as furious as
ever against the poor little horse, he went close up to it
and fired off both barrels at once.</p>
<p>The horse was not so much damaged as Eus&egrave;be himself.
The child held the pistol in both hands, the left hand being
close to the muzzle, and the result of his exploit was that
not only did the recoil of the pistol throw him down on his
back, but his hand was wounded and burnt by the explosion.
He fainted from the pain, and in this state was
picked up by his father, who ran into the garden at the
sound of the shot.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. de Malassise, instead of being angry with
their son, laid the blame of the accident on the unfortunate
horse; and a servant was at once ordered to break it in
pieces, and throw it upon the fire.</p>
<p>In consequence of this accident Eus&egrave;be had an attack of
fever, and was obliged to keep his bed for some days.
Most children in his place would have been taught a useful
lesson by the suffering he thus brought upon himself. Not
so Eus&egrave;be: he only took advantage of the anxiety his
parents felt about him, to be more tyrannical and capricious
than before.</p>
<p>About this time Mr. and Mrs. de Roisel came also with
their son to pass a few weeks at Dieppe, and Eus&egrave;be was
not yet quite restored to health when my little friend went
to see him. With tears in their eyes Eus&egrave;be&rsquo;s parents related
the accident which had happened to their dear child;
and it did not seem to occur to them that there was anything
in the affair for which he could be found fault with.
But Maurice felt indignant at what he considered cruelty
even towards a wooden horse. He was thinking of Cressida
while he listened to the story; but as Eus&egrave;be&rsquo;s horse
was not particularly described by his parents, it never
occurred to Maurice that it could be his own lost Cressida.</p>
<p>A few mornings later Maurice was taking a country
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
walk with his father and mother a little way out of Dieppe,
when, as they approached a small village, they heard the
loud and angry voices of children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-up, gee-up! Get on, lazy beast!&rdquo; said one
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t carry so many,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; exclaimed a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you he can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see. Hi! Gee-up, gee-up! Go along!&rdquo; and
immediately the sound of a shower of blows, rained upon
the back of some poor animal, reached the ears of Maurice,
who, without stopping to reflect, ran as fast as legs of eight
years old can run, in the direction of the noise.</p>
<p>He stopped at the entrance to a farm, where, in the courtyard,
he saw five or six boys, and as many little girls, all
clustered round a small pony. Two boys and a girl had
contrived to seat themselves upon its back; two or three
more were dragging it along by the bridle, while another
beat it with a stick behind. The pony hung down its head
in a way that was pitiful to see; it appeared to have a
shoulder dislocated, and a leg was broken above the knee,
and bandaged up. Its difficulty in &ldquo;going along&rdquo; seemed
quite accounted for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not ashamed,&rdquo; cried my little friend, &ldquo;to ride,
three of you at once, upon a little pony who is lame and
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the boys were inclined to answer by some impertinence,
but seeing Mr. and Mrs. de Roisel coming up
behind Maurice, they rather sulkily got down from the
pony. Then the poor animal, relieved from their weight,
raised its drooping head, and a sudden suspicion flashed
across the mind of Maurice. He cried out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it is Cressida!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice ran back to his parents to tell them of his discovery;
but instead of explaining himself, he could only
say,&mdash;&ldquo;Come, come quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img id="xxx17" src="images/i-239.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="349" />
<p class="pcap">TWO BOYS AND A GIRL HAD SEATED THEMSELVES UPON ITS BACK.</p>
</div>
<p>He took his mother&rsquo;s arm, for he was so agitated he
could scarcely stand.</p>
<p>Mr. de Roisel at once asked who was the owner of the
unfortunate Cressida. It was one of the boys present: but
the mother of this boy, being at work in the next field, observed
that something was going on, and she now came
up out of curiosity to see what was the matter. When Mr.
de Roisel said he wished to buy the horse, she replied that
she would sell it willingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you ask for it?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can give me whatever you please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A napoleon&mdash;is that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, it is too much,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for the horse
cost me only the trouble of asking for it. But if you like
to give so much, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; asked Mr. de Roisel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I got it in this way, sir. You must know I go
twice every day into the town to take milk to different
houses. One afternoon I was at the house of a rich
gentleman, when I heard him call out to the servant to
throw this little horse into the fire. It was in much better
condition then than it is now, and though it might not be
good enough for that rich gentleman&rsquo;s children to play
with, it was quite good enough for mine. So I begged
the servant to give it me rather than burn it, and he let
me have it. There you see, sir, how I got it without
paying anything. We poor people do not buy wooden
horses for our children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. de Roisel gave the napoleon to the good woman,
and some money also to her little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God for ever bless you, my good gentleman,&rdquo;
said she, astonished at his generosity; and she almost
suspected that he must know of some hidden treasure
inside the little horse.</p>
<p>When Eus&egrave;be heard how Maurice had recovered Cressida,
he was furious, and wanted the servant to be immediately
sent away who had spared the little horse from burning.
That evening Mr. de Malassise gave an account of the
circumstances under which he had bought the horse, and
spoke of the suspicion he had felt from the first of the man
who sold it. The next day information was given to the
police, and it was not long before the seller of the horse
was arrested. He proved to be one of the thieves who had
broken into Mr. Duberger&rsquo;s house. His accomplice was
a man who went about the country as a pedlar, selling
ribbons, silk-handkerchiefs, and toys. In this way he used
to obtain access to houses, learning where valuable things
were kept, and what were the habits of the family. The
two together had committed the robbery: both were tried
and convicted.</p>
<p>Mr. Duberger recovered only a small portion of the
objects of art that had been stolen, but he was much
rejoiced to hear that Maurice had got back his horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>It was the month of October, and Maurice had returned
to his own country home, where Cressida was installed
once more in its old stable. But the poor pony had lost
its former activity; it could not go faster than a walk,
and even that with difficulty.</p>
<p>One morning Maurice was in the garden, when he saw
Fritz approaching him, walking as fast as his old legs
would carry him, and having an open letter in his hand.
My little friend ran to meet him, when the old man embraced
the child with tears in his eyes, and called him his
benefactor. Seeing that Maurice did not understand why
he used the word, Fritz tried to explain, but for some time
he was too much affected to say anything intelligible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my poor niece!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;she owes her
life to you! Is it possible, so young a child! But I
never thought you like other children. You have saved
the life of a poor woman and her three little children.
Nobody would believe it; yet it is true; it is all told
here.&rdquo; And he pointed to the letter in his hand.</p>
<p>At this moment Mrs. de Roisel came up, and welcomed
Fritz back again. Then he soon became sufficiently calm
to explain himself clearly. It appeared that the young
woman, with her three children, whom Maurice had met
in the Luxembourg gardens, and had been so kind to,
was the niece of Fritz. No sooner had she arrived in
America than, overflowing with gratitude, she wrote her
uncle a long account of what had happened to them,
telling him how they had been saved by a young child
named Maurice de Roisel. It was this letter that Fritz
held in his hand. He had returned from Nuremberg to
his cottage in the village only the evening before, and had
come the first thing this morning to express his gratitude
to Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how,&rdquo; asked Fritz, &ldquo;came you to have so large a
sum of money by you to give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I did not give it all myself: besides, I was
obliged to part with Cressida.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; cried Fritz, starting back and turning
pale. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied Maurice, &ldquo;it was only by parting
with Cressida that I could procure the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right: I must not complain. If it was the
only way, you did right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oh Fritz! you cannot imagine in what a state I
found my poor Cressida again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the old man, with the joy of a child,
&ldquo;you <i>have</i> Cressida again then? You should have told
me so at first; it would have saved me pain. But you did
well to sell it, else how could my poor niece have joined
her husband?&mdash;my niece who is almost my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Maurice related Cressida&rsquo;s adventures, and the
wooden horse was brought out for Fritz to look at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not seriously damaged,&rdquo; said he, after examining
it. &ldquo;In a few days I will restore it to what it was a year
ago: but bear in mind, I am the only doctor that can
effect a cure. If, when I am no longer alive, it should be
damaged in the same way, there is no one who could mend
it. Watch then carefully over it in future.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>There were two horses that belonged to
my grandpapa when I was a little girl, that
I think you will like to hear about; for
although they were only common carthorses,
employed to do farm work, they set
a good example to children. They never quarrelled,
but were always good friends; they worked
together, and rested in the field together, and
always kept together.</p>
<p>I will tell you what happened one day. It was a
winter&rsquo;s morning, bitterly cold, and when Jack went
to drink at the pond he found it was frozen over.
He struck the ice two or three times with his foot
to break it, but it was too hard, so off he trotted to
Dobbin, who was standing a little way off, and
neighed his trouble to him. Dobbin returned to
the pond with Jack, and they both struck the ice

nice horses, and always help each other.</p>

<h2 id="c77">UNCLE JOHN&rsquo;S SCHOOL-DAYS.</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-248dt.jpg" alt="T" width="79" height="112" />
</div>
<p>This picture reminds me, children, of some
funny stories that I have heard your Uncle
John tell, when he and I were boy and girl
together, of his exploits as a schoolboy.
According to his account, not only he, but
most of his schoolfellows, used to lead
merry lives enough at school. They had a
great deal of what he called excellent fun, though I am
afraid it sometimes bordered upon mischief or naughtiness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
I used to consider that he and his schoolfellows were regular
heroes, as I listened to his stories when he came home for
the holidays; and even now I must confess I cannot help
laughing when I think of some of his naughty pranks.</p>
<p>Uncle John first went to a large school when he was
eleven years old, and I remember now the tremendous
hamper of good things he took with him. The boys who
slept in his bedroom were so pleased with the contents of
his hamper that they determined to make a great feast.
To add to their enjoyment they imagined themselves to be
settlers in the back woods of America or Australia. They
built a log-hut with bolsters, and had a sort of pic-nic.
One of them mounted on the top of the log-hut to look
out with his telescope for any approaching savages, while
the others enjoyed their suppers in and about the hut.
When their fun was at its height, the door softly opened,
and in walked Dr. Birchall, spectacles on nose, and cane in
hand. What followed may be imagined.</p>
<p>You would not recognize Uncle John himself, whom you
know only as a man six feet high, in that little lad on the
right hand side of the picture, half hiding under the bedclothes.
As a new boy he had no share either in the riot
or its punishment; except indeed in so far as his hamper
had supplied the means of riot. Still, what he saw made a
deep impression on his mind; and particularly he thought
a great deal of the inconvenience arising from the sudden
appearance of the master.</p>
<p>You know that Uncle John is an engineer now, and even
as a little boy he had a great turn for mechanical inventions.
Well, he pondered over some means by which such
a sudden interruption to the enjoyment of his schoolfellows
might be prevented in future; and I will tell you
what he did.</p>
<p>It happened that the large room in which he slept formed
the upper floor of a wing of the house, which had been
added to it when it became a school; and there was no
access to this room from the principal staircase of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
house. You had to pass through the room below, and go
up a little separate staircase to reach to floor above. The
lower room was also a bedroom for the boys, and Uncle
John&rsquo;s little scheme was this:&mdash;</p>
<p>He made a hole with a gimlet in the frame of one of
the windows of his bedroom, passed a piece of string
through the hole, and carried it outside the wall of the
house down to a similar hole in a window-frame of the
room below. To the end of the string in the upper room
was fastened a small rattle, while the other end of the
string&mdash;that in the room below&mdash;was taken into the bed of
a boy who slept near the window.</p>
<p>This admirable little invention once in order, there was
more rioting in the upper room than ever; and the master,
disturbed by the noise, soon went, cane in hand, to stop it.
The instant he set foot in the lower room, the boy there
who held the string in bed gave it a little pull; the rattle
sounded&mdash;ting! ting!&mdash;in the room above, and in an
instant every boy was in bed and snoring. Perhaps they
had been playing at leap-frog the moment before, but as
Dr. Birchall entered the room&mdash;and he crept up the staircase
very quietly that he might catch them unawares&mdash;he found
some twenty boys lying in bed, seemingly sound asleep,
though snoring unnaturally loud.</p>
<p>The doctor was so disconcerted by this unexpected state
of things that he retired at once, fancying perhaps that his
ears had deceived him when he thought he had heard a noise
in the room. The same thing happened two or three times:
the doctor was puzzled, and the invention appeared a complete
success; but at last all was discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-251.jpg" alt="Tossing in the blanket" width="500" height="761" />
</div>
<p>The boys one evening began imprudently to play at
&ldquo;Tossing in the blanket&rdquo; before they were undressed.
The rattle sounded, and they had just time to hide away the
blanket. But the doctor coming in, and finding they were
only then beginning to undress, knew they must have
been at some mischief, and began questioning one after
another. Unluckily, while he was in the room the rattle
sounded again by accident: perhaps the boy in the room
below had pulled the string by moving in bed. The doctor
looked about, found the rattle hanging just below the
window, saw the string, opened the window, and traced its
course outside, went down into the room below and understood
the whole arrangement. Then he put the rattle in
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
his pocket, and went away without saying a word. The
boys declared he had such difficulty in keeping himself
from laughing, that he was afraid to speak lest he should
burst out.</p>
<p>However, next day every boy in that room had a slight
punishment, and so the matter ended.</p>
<p>Now I will tell you another of Uncle John&rsquo;s pranks at
school. There was a large tree in the playground, the
upper branches of which spread out very near to the windows
of the bedroom I have been describing. One evening
Uncle John got hold of a large hand-bell, which was
used for ringing the boys up in the morning, and climbing
up the tree, he fastened it by a piece of string to a branch
near the top. Then another boy threw him the end of a
long string from a window of the bedroom into the tree,
and he fastened it to the bell in such a way that, when it
was pulled in the bedroom, it made the bell ring in the
tree. Having accomplished this arrangement, he came
down from the tree and went to bed.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock at night the household was disturbed by
the loud ringing of this bell. The master, in his dressing-gown,
came out into the playground and soon discovered
where the sound came from; but of course supposed that
some boy had climbed up into the tree, and was ringing
the bell there. It was the middle of summer, and a beautiful
moonlight night, so the boys could see from the windows
all that took place. Dr. Birchall stood at the foot of
the tree, looking up, and exclaimed angrily,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, you naughty boy! Come down, I say,
directly. Oh, I&rsquo;ll give you such a flogging! Stop that
horrible noise, I tell you, and come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell still went on ringing. At last the string&mdash;being
pulled too hard, I suppose, in the excitement of the fun&mdash;broke;
and the bell tumbled down from the top of the
tree, falling very near the old schoolmaster. This was
worse than all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you throw the bell at me?
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
Why, if it had hit me on the head, it might have killed me.
Oh, you wicked boy! I&rsquo;ll expel you, sir. I&rsquo;ll find out who
you are if I stop here till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, however, his patience was exhausted, and he
went away, but left an old butler to watch the tree all
night. The boys from the windows could see this man
settle himself comfortably on a seat which was at the foot
of the tree. He lighted his pipe, and prepared to carry
out his master&rsquo;s orders, and watch till daylight. By three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning the dawn broke; then the man
began to look up occasionally into the tree. Now and then
he walked a little distance away, first in one direction, and
then in another, to look into parts of the tree that he could
not see from underneath. He kept this up till the sun had
risen, and it was broad daylight; then at last he became
convinced that it was impossible there could be a boy in
the tree. He walked slowly into the house, still smoking
his pipe, with a puzzled expression on his face.</p>
<p>And I suspect he was not the only person who felt
puzzled. The next day the boys were going home for the
holidays, so that no further inquiry could be made. I
wonder if Dr. Birchall ever found out how it had been
managed!</p>

<h2 id="c79">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-256dt.jpg" alt="T" width="85" height="136" />
</div>
<p>The miracle I have to tell you of to-day,
my children, is called&mdash;Christ walking on
the waters. It followed closely upon that
I described in our last Sunday talk; I
mean, that of our Saviour feeding a multitude
of people with five barley loaves and
three small fishes.</p>
<p>As evening came on, the multitude that had been fed,
dispersed; and Christ desired His disciples to enter into
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
their boat, and go before Him to the town of Bethsaida,
where they might pass the night, while He went up into a
mountain alone, intending seemingly to spend the night in
prayer.</p>
<p>The disciples had not gone far upon their voyage, when
the light breeze which was bearing them on their way,
changed into a strong adverse wind. It had become dark,
&ldquo;and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,
and the ship was tossed with the waves.&rdquo; They were
overtaken in fact by one of those sudden squalls to which
the lake, or sea of Galilee is liable. In vain they rowed
with all their strength; the contrary wind drove them out
of their course into the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>In such an hour of danger they must have thought of
the time, not long before, when they were caught in
another storm on the same sea. But then their Master
was with them in the boat; at His command the sea
became calm, and the wind ceased. How they must have
wished that He were with them now, or that they could
call Him to them, that His voice might once more hush
the tempest into peace, and control the winds and waves!
They had entered the fourth watch of the night, which, as
the night was divided into only four watches, means that
the morning was approaching, and the storm was still
raging fiercely, when they beheld a human figure approaching,
walking on the surface of the water as if upon
firm ground.</p>
<p>Sailors and fishermen have been in all ages superstitious,
and those of that day generally held the belief that storms
were raised by spirits, who delighted in the turmoil of the
elements, and in the terror and destruction that were
caused. Some superstitious thought of this kind seems to
have been the first that entered the minds of the disciples,
as they saw the figure approaching on the water. What
followed is thus described by St. Matthew:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea,
they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them,
saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And
Peter answered Him, and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
come unto thee on the water. And Jesus said, Come.
And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked
on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind
boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,
saying, Lord, save me! And immediately Jesus stretched
forth His hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O
thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The want of a thorough, unbounded faith and confidence
in the power and divinity of our Saviour, was a fault which
He had to contend against even in the disciples, who
beheld His miracles almost daily. Peter and others who
were in the boat became afterwards apostles of Christianity,
and performed miracles themselves, when their faith must
have become perfect; but it seems to have grown up
gradually; and the words of Christ signify that Peter
failed to walk on the water himself on this occasion only
through his want of faith.</p>
<p>St. Matthew goes on to tell us that when our Saviour
came into the ship, the wind ceased. Then the disciples
came round Him, worshipping Him, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;Of a truth
thou art the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c80">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3><span class="sc">Sammy.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-260ds.jpg" alt="S" width="82" height="136" />
</div>
<p>Sammy is a great friend of mine, and a
brave boy too, I can tell you: he is only
seven years old, but quite a little man.
Sammy&rsquo;s grandmamma was my nurse
when I was a child, and through her I
came to know him. She married a
fisherman at Hastings one summer when
we were staying there, and has lived from
that time to this in a cottage on the beach just out of the
town. Her husband no longer follows the calling of a
fisherman, for he is very old; but he lets out rowing boats,
of which two or three are generally to be seen drawn up
on the beach close to the cottage.</p>
<p>The daughter of this old couple married a shipwright,
and has four children, of whom Sammy is the eldest.
She, her husband, and all the children, live with her father
and mother in the cottage on the beach. How they all
squeeze in, I do not pretend to know: it is a puzzle to me,
but they manage somehow.</p>
<p>I had not seen my old nurse for some years&mdash;indeed not
since her daughter&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;when, being at Hastings
not long ago, I went one afternoon to pay her a visit. I
approached the cottage from the beach, and entered at
the door of a sort of kitchen which I found open. The
proper entrance to the cottage, it appears, is from the road
at the other side, where there is a little garden. However,
I went in, and finding the kitchen empty, went through it
to another open door leading into a sitting-room. Through
this door, without being observed myself, I beheld one of
the pleasantest sights that has ever met my eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>The children had evidently been out to meet their father
on his way home from work, and they were all coming through
the garden and just entering the opposite door
together, as you see them in the picture. Sammy marched
in front, carrying his father&rsquo;s basket of tools upon his
shoulder as proudly as if he bore a treasure. Father
himself was carrying little Topsey, the youngest child,
upon <i>his</i> shoulder, who pulled his hair and crowed and
laughed all the time; while the other two children, Mary
Jane and Florence Bessy, walked, or rather jumped and
danced, on either side of him. The old man in the cottage
was smiling a welcome to them as they came in: in short
every face, from the youngest to the eldest there, looked
bright and happy.</p>
<p>As I stood there observing, I mentally thanked heaven
for the happiness which love and good temper can bring
to the poorest cottage. My presence was soon noticed:
my old nurse appeared heartily glad to see me, and
showed me her grandchildren with great pride; but I
did not remain long, for I saw that their tea was ready,
and I was disturbing them. Afterwards I was often at the
cottage; but I must hasten on to describe what first made
me rank Sammy among my little friends.</p>
<p>One morning I was rambling along the shore, sometimes
walking on the sand, sometimes on the slippery green
rocks, reading occasionally a few lines of a book I had in
my hand, but more frequently looking out to sea and
watching the fishing boats riding bravely on the waves,
when I suddenly became aware that the tide had risen
quickly, and that I was hemmed in on a sort of island. I
found water in front and on each side of me, while behind
me was a ridge of rocks too rugged and slippery to
climb.</p>
<p>Now my life was in no danger I daresay, but the prospect
of having to walk through the water up to my knees was
disagreeable. Very near me, but separated by some impassable
rocks, stood the cottage of my old nurse, looking
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
tranquil and pretty in the sunshine; while close by it, in a
little cove formed by a wooden breakwater, a small boat
was moored. I approached as near as I could and called
for help. Presently little Sammy made his appearance in
answer to my cries; but instead of returning into the
cottage to obtain help from some grown-up person, he set
to work at once to unmoor the boat, jumped into it, and
began paddling along with a single oar round the breakwater
and the rocks to where I stood.</p>
<p>I was in an agony of fear lest he should be carried out
to sea, for he was certainly too little and too weak to have
made head against any current or wind that there might
be. However, the boat soon touched the sand close to me.
I scrambled in, getting very wet the while, and then by
our united efforts we got her off again and paddled her
round to her own little harbour.</p>
<p>Once in safety, I exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, Sammy, how
dangerous for you to come alone! why didn&rsquo;t you call
somebody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d drown furst,&rdquo; said Sammy, with a
grin; &ldquo;but grandfather&rsquo;s ill and father&rsquo;s out, so I wor the
only man at home, yer see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a true little man you are,&rdquo; said I to my friend
Sammy; and I am sure my little readers think so too.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">A FRIENDLY PARTY.&mdash;WHAT ADRIENNE DID WITH HER TEN PIECES OF GOLD.&mdash;UNEXPECTED VISITORS.&mdash;A HAPPY MEETING.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-266dw.jpg" alt="W" width="84" height="179" />
</div>
<p>We must suppose that an interval of a year
and a half has passed since the events
happened which I related in the last
chapter. The family of de Roisel are
staying at Paris, as usual during the
winter; and this chapter opens on a
certain day, soon after Christmas, when
they had guests to dinner. Eus&egrave;be, and
his father and mother, were there; also
Adrienne Fallachon, accompanied by
her father and her English governess.
Maurice had met Adrienne again in the
Luxembourg gardens, and at length the two families had
become acquainted.</p>
<p>The dinner was in the middle of the day on account of
the children, and afterwards, to amuse them as they sat
round the fire, a singular sort of game was introduced.
All were to confess in turn such faults or follies as they
were conscious of in themselves, and to relate what bad,
or silly, or ridiculous actions these faults had led them
into,&mdash;it being understood that the grown-up people were
only to speak of the faults and follies of their childhood.</p>
<p>They had just settled down to the game when Mr.
Duberger came in. He joined in it at once, and related,
with great goodnature and perfect candour and simplicity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
a multitude of absurdities and mistakes which he had
committed in complete innocence, but through negligence
and absence of mind. He made every one laugh heartily
at his stories.</p>
<p>Eus&egrave;be was the only one of the party who had nothing
to relate, for he knew of no imperfection in himself. Some
of those present tried to help his memory a little; but no!
he could remember no fault he had ever committed. He
recollected, and related, only deeds of heroism, which did
not fail to cause a slight astonishment in his hearers.</p>
<p>Adrienne, who, under the watchful care of her governess,
had much improved in character since we knew her
before, spoke of her own caprice and selfishness; and said
she always should consider she had caused the misfortunes
which befell Cressida, through refusing to give her ten
pieces of gold to the poor woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do at last with those ten
napoleons?&rdquo; asked Mr. Duberger.</p>
<p>Miss Henriette, the English governess, replied for
Adrienne: &ldquo;To tell you that, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;would not
be keeping to our game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can tell you what she did with them,&rdquo; said
Maurice. &ldquo;When she went home that day, she had such
a scolding from Miss Henriette for her hardness of heart,
that she was very sorry indeed, and I have heard she cried
a good deal. Well, a day or two afterwards a poor workman
was killed, in falling from the scaffolding of a house,
that was being built close by. Adrienne heard that he
had left a widow and children in the greatest distress; and
what do you think she did? She asked Miss Henriette to
take her to see this poor woman, and gave her the ten
napoleons. I know too that she has often been kind to
poor people since, and given away her pocket-money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all quite true,&rdquo; said Adrienne&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;I should
have told you of it long ago, but Adrienne made me promise
that I would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl blushed, and her governess, who was
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
sitting by her, took her hand; but at this moment the
general attention was drawn in another direction. A
servant came into the room, and spoke in a low voice to
Mrs. de Roisel, who replied aloud: &ldquo;Ask them to come
in here, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment the servant announced Mr. and Mrs.
Leopold Kirchner; and a lady and gentleman with three
children entered the room.</p>
<p>The name of Fritz&rsquo;s niece&mdash;the poor woman whom Maurice
had helped&mdash;was known to every one present; it
was known also that her husband, having already made a
good fortune in America, was about to return to Europe
with his family, but their arrival at this time was unexpected.
Their dress showed that they had but just come
off a journey, and it was evident that, on arriving in Paris,
their first thought had been to pay a visit to Maurice.</p>
<p>Finding so many persons in the room, the new-comers
stood for a moment confused; and Mrs. de Roisel hastened
forward to welcome them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; exclaimed the little girl, &ldquo;here is
Maurice. I know him, though he is grown much bigger in
two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice was immediately embraced and kissed by every
member of the family in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rests with God,&rdquo; said Leopold Kirchner, with deep
emotion,&mdash;&ldquo;it rests with God to reward such actions as
yours; but if ever it should happen that we can be of any
service to you, remember that all we possess, and all we
can do, is at your command. But we had another benefactor
at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was Mr. Duberger,&rdquo; Maurice hastened to
say, glad to turn attention away from himself. &ldquo;Here he
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Leopold Kirchner to him, &ldquo;I am not surprised
to see you here. My wife&rsquo;s uncle, Fritz Keller, who
wrote to us very often about Maurice de Roisel, told us
how you had become his friend and that of his parents.
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
It is natural that those who have good hearts should come
together, and esteem and love each other. I find no
words, sir, in which I can express my gratitude to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img id="xxx19" src="images/i-269.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="778" />
<p class="pcap">MAURICE WAS EMBRACED BY ALL THE FAMILY.</p>
</div>
<p>There was an evident sincerity, and a certain dignity
too, in this language that went to the hearts of all. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
they talked of Fritz, who had died at a great age towards
the beginning of the winter; and Maurice brought in
Cressida to show the horse to his new friends. He had
learnt from Mr. Duberger how to value it, and no longer
used it as a plaything. Mr. Duberger always declared it
to be the most remarkable and ingenious automaton that
had ever been made.</p>
<p>When Cressida was brought in Eus&egrave;be informed his
parents that he must go away. He had not amused himself
at all, and the sight of Cressida always put him out of
temper. He regretted so much that when the little horse
belonged to him, he had not destroyed it.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION.</span></h3>
<p>Something tells me that among my little readers there
may be a few&mdash;perhaps the oldest or most clever&mdash;who
wish to ask me certain questions. They may say to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what moral lesson do you draw from your story?
That boy, Eus&egrave;be, who is about the naughtiest and most
disagreeable boy that ever lived, is left just as well off, and
as happy as the dear good little Maurice. An author can
make shadow or sunshine fall upon his paper as he pleases:
then he should punish the bad, and make the good
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply, I say to you: My dear little gentlemen
and my pretty young ladies, you must know that Providence,
which watches over us from above, does not institute
special rewards for virtue, as men may do; nor has any
system like ours for punishing the bad. Yet Providence
is always just. To those who do good no other reward is
sometimes accorded than that of being good: but, in truth,
that is the best reward of all. If a man bestow charity in
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
the hope that God will, as a reward, render him prosperous,
he is not really charitable, but only a speculator who risks
a little in the hope that he may gain much. Nor can we
always see how Providence punishes the bad. They may
be rich and prosperous, yet they may suffer from the hatred
that is in their hearts, and from the envy they feel towards
those who appear happy.</p>
<p>But to satisfy my little readers I will leap over the fifteen
years which separate the present time from that at which
my story began, and see what has become of the principal
characters.</p>
<p>To begin with Eus&egrave;be. You may meet him everywhere;
at the theatres, in the park, at races, always with his glass
in his eye, generally with a cigar in his mouth, and dressed
in a conspicuous and ridiculous fashion. But you may ask
perhaps what he does? Nothing: that is the only thing he
is capable of doing. With a cold heart and an empty head
he has no friendships, nor has he intellect enough even to
enjoy his amusements.</p>
<p>That attack of the nerves which his parents always
dreaded, but which never came, was an excuse for not
working at college; and when his education was supposed
to be finished, it was discovered one fine day that he knew
nothing and was fit for nothing. But I am forgetting: he
has one occupation, which is the misery of his life. His
occupation is to envy. When any of his old college
companions or his schoolfellows are successful in literature,
science, or art, he is miserable. It is torture to him to
hear them praised. He does what he can to detract from
their merit and renown; and finds a certain satisfaction&mdash;perhaps
a slight consolation&mdash;in laughing at them for their
application and industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How a fellow can be such a fool as to work hard in
that way!&rdquo; he will say with an air of superiority.</p>
<p>In short, Eus&egrave;be would like to sweep away all genius,
talent, and wit from the face of the earth, and when there
remained only fools upon it, he might be king among them.
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
And now, my little readers, what do you think of Eus&egrave;be?
Is he happy, do you suppose?</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">

<p class="pcap">WITH HIS GLASS IN HIS EYE, AND DRESSED IN A RIDICULOUS FASHION.</p>
</div>
<p>You ask now if Adrienne Fallachon became a duchess
after all?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>No; far from it. She grew up wiser and less ambitious
than her father. She has lately married a young lawyer, a
cousin of her own, whom she loved. So she has not even
changed her name, which is still Fallachon.</p>
<p>And Maurice?</p>
<p>Maurice has lately left college, where he has greatly
distinguished himself. As a young man, he is still as kind,
gentle, and brave, as he used to be when a boy; and is
as generally loved as his cousin Eus&egrave;be is disliked. His
talent and his inclination both seem to point to a literary
career, as the one he will take to; nor can any be more
honourable or useful when the writer teaches what is true,
and good, and noble. I am sure we all wish him success
and happiness.</p>

<p>This, you see, is a picture of goats,
enjoying a feast of nice fresh young
leaves from that tree which hangs over
the paling. How greedily the little kid
there, standing on his hind legs, reaches
up to eat, while the other little fellow
stands with pricked-up ears and wide-open
eyes, holding a sprig of some tree
in his mouth. He has heard a noise,
and is on the watch, fearful lest some
enemy should come, and ready to spring
away in a moment.</p>
<p>This picture just represents a family of common European
goats. They are fleet, active creatures. In their wild state
they delight in climbing rocks, and bounding about at the
edge of precipices, as sure-footed as the chamois. Even
our tame goats here at home are so fond of climbing that
they always get on to some high place, even on to the tops
of houses or outbuildings, when they have a chance.</p>
<p>You know, children, how tame and gentle these creatures
can be made, for I am sure there is scarcely one of the
readers of &ldquo;<span class="sc">Wide-Awake</span>&rdquo; but has ridden in a goat-chaise
at some time of his or her life; yes, and has sat up in state,
and held the reins, and driven the poor little willing goat
too. But I trust that the little hands have been merciful
the while, and that the poor goat&rsquo;s mouth has not been
jerked and dragged till every tooth in its head ached.
And how about the whips? Goats&rsquo; skins are not very
sensitive perhaps, but I am terribly afraid that some little
children whip their goats till they must smart again. Now
if your consciences accuse you&mdash;and I address myself to
any of my little readers&mdash;make up your minds never to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
cruel to goats, or any other living creature, again. Few
things are more horrid to me than a cruel child.</p>
<p>When I was in India I had a number of goats: they
were kept to give milk. I grew quite fond of them, and
they knew me so well that they would come trotting after
me, baaing at me for bread or sugar, whenever I walked
out in the compound. There was only one disagreeable
quality about my goats: they were not sweet-smelling, and
on that account were not very pleasant pets.</p>
<p>I have been told that at the Cape of Good Hope large
flocks of these animals are kept, and they are very sagacious,
requiring no goat-herd to look after them. In this
respect they are very different from sheep: they start off in
an orderly flock of their own accord to find their food in
the morning, and they return in the same orderly fashion in
the evening.</p>
<p>Goats are almost the only animals that will face fire. On
some occasions when stables have caught fire, they have
been known to save the lives of horses by setting them a
good example, and boldly leading the way through smoke
and flame out of the burning stables.</p>

</div>
<p>The next of her pets that Aunt Totty told us
about was a dog called &ldquo;Tiger.&rdquo; This was
what she told us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiger,&rdquo; said Aunt Totty, &ldquo;flourished about
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
the same time as Moko, the monkey I described to you
the other day. He was a very big dog, something between
a Newfoundland and a Mount St. Bernard. He
belonged to my old nurse and foster-mother, who lived on
a little farm not very far from Marseilles. Her husband,
who was now a farmer, had once been a soldier, and
was a brave and worthy man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, after I had had the measles, I was sent for
change of air to stay a week or two with my old nurse.
The chateau, where we then lived, was not many leagues
away; still for some reason the change of air was considered
necessary for my complete cure. How I enjoyed
the visit I can scarcely tell you. I had everything entirely
my own way, and of course had a holiday from all lessons.
From the moment I entered the house, Tiger adopted me
as his playfellow and friend. I loved him dearly, and had
a great respect for him at the same time, for never was
dog at once so gentle and so terrible. He would jump
upon me to caress me, and knock me down flat under the
weight of his great paws, while I in turn used to sit upon
his back, roll on the top of him when he was resting, and
unmercifully pull his ears and his tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was mine to do as I liked with, for my nurse would
deny me nothing, and I chose to adopt Tiger for my own.
Everyone loved the brave big dog who knew him: but now
I must come to the point of my story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening, at twilight, I was out playing with my
little foster-brother a short distance from the cottage, on
the outskirts of a large wood. We were sitting on a bank
talking, and he was telling me of a ghost which, he said,
had been frightening everybody in the neighbourhood of
late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; cried little Pierrette, shuddering, &lsquo;this frightful
ghost makes the grown-up people run away: what should
we do if we saw it now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;a boy ought never to be
frightened&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo; I got so far when, to my horror, I saw,
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
coming out of the dark wood, a tall white figure, which
came walking slowly towards us. As it approached slowly,
slowly, a cold shiver ran down my back, my eyes seemed
starting from my head, and shrieking out, &lsquo;The ghost,
the ghost!&rsquo; I ran back towards the cottage. Pierrette&mdash;in
consequence perhaps of what I had just said&mdash;stood his
ground boldly; at least for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part I thought of nothing but myself, and
rushed screaming into the house. Pierrette&rsquo;s father, Pierre,
ran to the door, hearing my cries, and could himself see
the terrible ghost at a distance. He at once took down
an old gun from above the chimney-piece&mdash;one which, I
believe, had figured in Napoleon&rsquo;s campaigns&mdash;and hastily
loading it with deer-shot, marched out in the direction of
the phantom. Walking a few steps, he called out in a
voice which he strove in vain to make firm,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost made no answer, but waved his arms about
in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; again cried Pierre. &lsquo;If you do not
answer, I shall fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again the ghost only waved his long arms&mdash;arms
which appeared to me to reach the sky. Pierre put the
gun to his shoulder, he pulled the trigger, but it did not
go off; it was old and out of order. Then a shout of
diabolical laughter broke the quiet night, echoing all
around. And I regret to say my nurse&rsquo;s husband fled&mdash;positively
fled; caught his foot against a stone, tumbled
on his nose, picked himself up again, and ran into the
cottage&mdash;though I must do him the justice to say that he
caught me by the hand, and dragged me in along with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once safe inside, we both thought of Pierrette,&mdash;where
was he? And I told how he had stood still when I ran
away. Then a happy thought occurred to me: I called
Tiger from his kennel; and as, on looking out, we could
no longer see the ghost, we all&mdash;father, mother, I, and
Tiger&mdash;went out to look about for the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-282.jpg" alt="Dog and child asleep" width="500" height="381" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;After searching a little while in vain, we returned
to the cottage, where, at the door, we found Tiger and
Pierrette lying down together waiting for our return&mdash;the
little boy having fallen asleep with his head comfortably
resting on the dog&rsquo;s body, just as you see them in the
picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next evening, as soon as it began to grow dark,
we watched for the ghost, and saw it appear again almost
at the same hour in the same place. But this time the
brave Tiger was let loose upon him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The phantom had only advanced a little way from the
wood, and was beginning to wave his long arms, when
Tiger, without the least hesitation, sprang upon him,
howling with rage. The ghost showed no fight at all,
but at once turned and fled. In running, he got his feet
entangled in the sheets which he was wrapped up in, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
fell to the ground. Tiger was upon him in an instant, and
the ghost cried for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre and some other peasants came to the rescue,
when they found that they had been so frightened only by
one of themselves&mdash;a drunken, idle fellow, who, rather than
work, played this trick. And why? Well, partly for fun,
no doubt, but also in order to steal his neighbours&rsquo; fowls
and vegetables; for he thought that no one would venture
to come out at night to interfere with the ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fame of Tiger&rsquo;s exploit was so great, that he was
soon afterwards purchased at a high price by the owner of
some flocks of sheep, which pastured in the mountains;
and who said very reasonably:&mdash;&lsquo;The dog who dare attack
a ghost will never be afraid of wolves.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Peter Pryor must needs pry
into everything. Here you see him in the
kitchen, taking a look into the saucepan to see what
there is for dinner. Cookey looks very kind, and
not at all angry. But Peter&rsquo;s mamma just comes
in and says: &ldquo;Now, Peter, I will not have you
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
prying; you have no business here; go out of the
kitchen directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter drops the lid of the saucepan, scalds his
fingers, slips from the stool, and scrapes his chin.
I am afraid nothing will cure Peter of prying, except
some really bad hurt.</p>
<p>One day this silly little boy got into the fireplace,
(luckily there was no fire,) and began climbing up
the chimney to see where the soot came from. A
quantity fell on him, and he soon came back&mdash;not
a bit frightened, only laughing,&mdash;and said to his
Nurse,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&rsquo;ee, Nana, Peter hab turned into back

<h2 id="c88">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>CURE OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-287da.jpg" alt="A" width="47" height="48" />
</div>
<p>Among the miracles which our Lord next performed
was that of giving speech and hearing
to a deaf and dumb man. This man was brought
by his friends, who placed him before the Saviour,
with the earnest request that He would put His hand on
him. St. Mark thus describes the miracle:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;And they brought unto Him one that was deaf, and
had an impediment in his speech; and they besought Him
to put His hand upon him. And He took him aside from
the multitude, and put His fingers into his ears, and He
spat, and touched his tongue. And looking up to heaven,
He sighed, and saith unto him, &lsquo;Ephphatha,&rsquo; that is,
&lsquo;Be opened.&rsquo; And straightway his ears were opened,
and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake
plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot always determine the reasons that influenced
the actions of our Lord; nor indeed is it necessary we
should. We cannot doubt, judging by other miracles, but
He could have cured the man by a word, or the mere
exercise of His will; yet on this occasion He chose to
touch the man&rsquo;s eyes and his tongue, and to sigh a mental
prayer to His Father.</p>
<p>His reasons for taking the man aside from the multitude
we can more easily surmise. It may have been as a lesson
to His disciples, to teach them that they should not make
a vain display of their works of mercy; or it may have
been that, not wishing to excite still further at the moment
the enmity of the Pharisees, He desired that the fame of
His miracles should not be further spread. But whatever
our Saviour&rsquo;s motive in taking the man aside, it is evident
that the multitude crowded about Him, and beheld the
miracle; for St. Mark goes on to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And He charged them that they should tell no man;
but the more He charged them, so much the more a great
deal they published it; and were beyond measure astonished,
saying, &lsquo;He hath done all things well: He maketh
the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scripture tells us that, after Jesus had performed
this miracle, great multitudes came unto Him, bringing
with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, or maimed.
These poor suffering creatures were cast down at Jesus&rsquo;
feet, and He healed them. &ldquo;And the people wondered
when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see; and they
glorified the God of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ performed a great many more miracles, my
children, than I shall be able to tell you about, and you
must read of them for yourselves in the Bible when you
grow a little older. Most of our Saviour&rsquo;s miracles were,
as I have before told you, miracles of healing, and works
of mercy; but, on one occasion about this time, He performed
a miracle to pay what was called the tribute money.</p>
<p>This tribute was a tax levied for the support of the
temple at Jerusalem. It consisted in the annual payment
of a coin called a dedrachma&mdash;two drachmas&mdash;by every
person over twenty years of age. It was devoted chiefly
to the purchase of such things as were used for the sacrifices
in the Jewish sanctuary. This tax was sometimes
called &ldquo;The ransom money, or atonement for the soul,&rdquo;
and was paid equally by rich and poor, to show that the
souls of all were considered to be equal in the sight of
God. It was an acknowledgment that all were sinners,
and all alike needed to be ransomed.</p>
<p>We are told by St. Matthew that when Jesus and His
disciples came to Capernaum, &ldquo;They that received tribute
money, came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master
pay tribute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter, who had heard our Lord teach His followers to
give to all their dues, answered promptly to the inquiry,
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and then went into the house where Jesus was.
Our Saviour, although not present at the conversation
with the collector of tribute, knew perfectly well what had
taken place, and He anticipated what Peter was about to
tell Him by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of
the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children or
of strangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter, you must know, was sometimes addressed by his
first name of Simon. Now Christ, in putting this question
to him, meant to ask whether He, as the Son of God, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
whom the temple was dedicated, ought to pay tribute for
its support, as kings do not tax their children. Nevertheless,
He added words signifying that lest the Pharisees
should charge Him with despising the temple and its
services, the tribute should be paid. And He went on:
&ldquo;Go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the
fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his
mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and
give unto them for me and thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter obeyed. He went and caught the fish, found in its
mouth a shekel&mdash;equal to four drachmas&mdash;and with it paid
the tribute.</p>

<h2 id="c89">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3>MARGARET.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-291dt.jpg" alt="T" width="86" height="139" />
</div>
<p>The little friend that you see in the picture
is a little girl that I knew long ago. As
you can judge from the picture, her father
and mother were not what we call gentlefolk.
But simple country people as Margaret&rsquo;s
parents were, they had as warm
hearts&mdash;yes, and as good manners too&mdash;as
you would meet with anywhere.</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s father was just an honest English farmer, and
her mother a worthy active farmer&rsquo;s wife, while little Margaret
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
herself was the perfection of a merry country girl.
She was up early to help her mother in the morning. She
would rise at cock-crow, wash and dress herself, make her
own bed, and then kneel down, as we see her in the picture,
and say her prayers. And if it was summer, the sun, in
rising would cast his slanting rays in at the window, and
gild her pretty head the while with his soft light.</p>
<p>I had been very ill, and went down to stay at the farm
to get strong and well again. In fact I took a lodging
there for a short time. But I already knew the people, for
I had once lived in the neighbourhood. It was the month
of October when I went down, after having been long confined
to my sick room in London; and I can remember
now how beautiful the woods looked, as I drove from the
station up the hill to the farm-house. The leaves of the
oak were already mellowing into bronze; the beeches were
changing to a deep orange; and here and there the pale
yellow of the chestnut showed in relief against the dark
green of the unchanging fir. The whole landscape glowed
in the warm lights and shadows of autumn colouring.</p>
<p>The old farm-house was perfect in point of cleanliness
and comfort. I soon regained my health and strength, and
was beginning to think of returning home again, when the
sad event happened which I am going to tell you of.</p>
<p>Little Margaret used to wander in and out, and round
about, near her father&rsquo;s farm, just as she pleased. She
was known and loved by everyone, great and small; by the
young children particularly, who would run out of their
cottages as she passed to see and speak to her. One evening
she was returning home across a plot of open ground
near the farm, when she saw, drawn up out of the road, one
of those houses on wheels which gipsies travel about in.
A woman stood outside with a little brown baby in her
arms; and Margaret could not pass without saying a word
to the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t look well,&rdquo; said Margaret to the
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, missie, nor &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t well neither,&rdquo; replied the
woman; &ldquo;and I have one inside a deal worser. I don&rsquo;t
know what ails &rsquo;em. Would yer like to step inside and see
the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret ran up the steps without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
and found a poor sick boy about seven years old stretched
upon a hard mattress, tossing from side to side in what
was evidently a bad fever. The good-hearted child said to
the woman,&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure your little boy is very ill; I will
run home and ask mother what you had better do for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried home full of the subject, and I was sitting
in the garden when she came running in. I asked the reason
of her haste, when she told me of the sick children.
From her description, the idea at once occurred to me that
they were sick with scarlet fever; and the parish doctor,
whom we asked to go to see them, afterwards confirmed
my opinion.</p>
<p>Those children, however, struggled through the terrible
illness; but, alas! our little Margaret&mdash;I say <i>our</i> because a
strong love had grown up in my heart for the good and
pretty child&mdash;sickened with the fever, which she had
caught during those few minutes spent in the fever-stricken
cart. Days of wearing anxiety and nights of watching followed.
It was heart-breaking to see the little head rolling
from side to side upon the pillow, while the pretty eyes
looked with unmeaning gaze upon us all: the voice too,
that we had so loved to hear, sounded strange as it talked
in the wild delirium of fever.</p>
<p>After a time the fever abated, and the child became
more tranquil, though weaker. One day some sad words
fell from the little parched lips: &ldquo;Mother dear,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;set me up a little; I want to see out of the window, and
say good-bye to everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor mother raised her up, and Margaret could see
the soft evening sky, and the outside world just melting
into twilight under the warm smile of the setting sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it, as they say, mother, more beautiful there?&rdquo; she
whispered, pointing to the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, darling?&rdquo; asked her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In heaven,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;which I shall see so
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not soon! Oh, my darling, not soon! don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo;
cried the poor farmer&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very soon. Don&rsquo;t cry, mother dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Margaret was right. Only a few days more, and
the setting sun shed its warm light upon her grave.</p>
<p>This is a very, very sad story; and perhaps has brought
tears into the eyes of some of my dear little readers. I
hardly know why I have told it, except that my stories
would not be like reality, if they were always happy. The
world has shadows as well as sunshine.</p>

<h2 id="c91">THE SHRIKE, OR BUTCHER BIRD.</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-299dm.jpg" alt="M" width="86" height="152" />
</div>
<p>My little readers have, none of them perhaps,
ever seen this bird: it is not very
common in England, though found in
most parts of the globe. This one we
see in the picture is feeding its young
with an insect, or beetle; but the Shrike
is a very voracious and cruel bird. It
not only eats insects, reptiles, little mice
and such things, but attacks the young
unfledged nestlings of smaller birds than itself, and
devours them. This is why it is called by the ugly name
of Butcher Bird. Fancy the horrid thing devouring the
tender, weak, and helpless young of its own species!
Poor little baby-birds settled comfortably in their nests,
waiting for the return of papa or mamma with food, are
pounced upon by these cruel creatures, carried off, torn
limb from limb, and used to feed a nestful of little butcher
birds!</p>
<p>I never saw a Shrike but once, and that was many years
ago. I was driving with a relation of mine, the wife of a
country clergyman, to visit a sick child, the daughter of
one of the parishioners. As we drove up to the farmhouse,
we met the child&rsquo;s father, who was a small farmer,
coming out at the door with a gun in his hand. After
inquiring about the child, we naturally asked what he was
going to shoot, for it was not the shooting season. He
told us in reply that he had just seen a grey shrike up in an
apple tree in the orchard, and he was going to have a shot
at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For it be a rare bird, that it be,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;this
be the furst as I&rsquo;ve seen since I wor a boy, and loike
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
enough I mayn&rsquo;t never see another, so I be a&rsquo;going to
shoot un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the bird is so cruel itself, I did not feel inclined
to see it killed, so I wished the farmer good morning.
But he did &ldquo;shoot un,&rdquo; I afterwards learnt; in fact, he
butchered the butcher bird, and had it stuffed too, and put
into a glass case. In this condition I saw it. It was a
handsome bird; the general colour of it was grey, but it
had a white breast, and some strong black marks upon
the head, wings, and tail. Its size was about that of a
pigeon.</p>
<p>There is another kind of Shrike, which is found in
South America, and is called the Bush Shrike. This bird
is rather larger, and more powerful than the European
Shrike, and has a handsome tuft of feathers on its head.
It is found in forests and thick brushwood, where it passes
its time in a constant search for insects, reptiles, and the
young of other birds, which it devours like the European
Shrike. It possesses a strong and rather hooked beak,
and is a formidable enemy to any creature it may attack.</p>
<p>But the country in which the Shrike lives on the best
terms with man is New South Wales. There it is very
common, and in appearance resembles the Shrike of
Europe. It is called by the colonists the Piping Crow, on
account of the rich and varied strain of song it pours forth
in early morning and towards evening. In this gift of
song it seems to differ from the European bird, or at least,
if the latter possesses such a merit, it has not been observed.
In New South Wales the Shrike prefers the open localities
to the wooded districts, and in particular shows a preference
for those parts which have been cleared by the settlers.
In fact, in that country, the Piping Crow is looked upon as
being a particularly trustful bird,&mdash;trustful, I mean, of
man. It will build its nest in the plantations or gardens
of the colonists, who, particularly in the back settlements,
do all they can to encourage it for the sake of its pleasant
morning and evening song.</p>

<p>A famished Wolf was prowling

the door of a cottage built in a
forest, he heard a mother say

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, or I will throw
you out of the window, and
the Wolf shall eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wolf sat all day waiting
at the door. In the evening
he heard the same woman
fondling and petting her child,
and saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good boy now, and
if the Wolf should come, we
will kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wolf, hearing these
words, went home, gaping
with cold and hunger. On
his reaching his den, Mistress Wolf inquired
of him why he returned tired and
supperless, so contrary to his wont. He
replied, &ldquo;Why, forsooth! because I believed
what a woman said!&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene I.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-304da.jpg" alt="A" width="132" height="207" />
</div>
<p>A pretty little girl is Tiny, and
she is also <i>now</i> a very nice one,
but she used to have one great
fault&mdash;she was very conceited.
She fancied herself the prettiest
and cleverest child in the world,
and when she was with other
little girls of the village where
she lived, she was in the habit of
telling them very plainly what
she thought of herself; which,
you may imagine, was not the
way to make them like her. One
day she had a lesson, however,
which, I am glad to say, quite
cured her; and I am going to
tell you how the happy change was brought about.</p>
<p>That little girl you see in the picture, standing on the
other side of the brook, is Tiny. This brook is in a little
wood close to her mother&rsquo;s cottage, and she has just been
looking at the reflection of her own pretty face in the
water, and thinking how much prettier it is than any other
faces she ever sees. While she is occupied in this way,
she hears somebody laugh, and looking up, sees a beautiful
lady and an ugly little dwarf standing on the other side
of the brook. The lady has bright wings upon her
shoulders, and both she and the dwarf are laughing at
poor little Tiny.</p>
<p>Tiny does not quite like being laughed at, but has no
doubt they are admiring her all the same. She is very
much astonished, though; when she hears the lady say:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-305.jpg" alt="Child, lady, and dwarf" width="500" height="402" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tiny, I suppose you think yourself quite perfect.
You are a vain little creature; and if you remain through
life the same, nobody will love you, and you will never be
happy: I will help you to become wiser. I am going to
give you a pair of wings, with which you will be able to
fly about, and see and hear a great deal which will serve
as a useful lesson to you. The wings will only last till sunset,
but you will have time to find out that there is vanity
in others as well as yourself, and to judge how silly it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying this, the fairy with her attendant dwarf
disappear. But Tiny feels a strange pricking at her
shoulders, and presently finds herself raised up from the
ground by a pair of wings, which have grown out suddenly.
She was always small for her age; and that is the reason
she is called Tiny; but now she discovers that she has
become no bigger than a little bird.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene II.</span></h3>
<p>After flying a little way, she settles down among some
pretty wild flowers, and finds herself close to a large owl.
&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; he says, for he cannot see well in the
daylight. &ldquo;Please, sir, I&rsquo;m a little girl, only a good fairy
has given me wings, that I may see the world, and grow
wiser.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; laughs the owl, &ldquo;see the world
indeed! Why, I&rsquo;ve lived in the same barn all my life, and
I&rsquo;m the wisest bird there is; everybody knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a conceited, stupid old thing!&rdquo; says Tiny to
herself as she flies away.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene III.</span></h3>
<p>Presently she sees a stork and a kangaroo, who appear
to be at high words. &ldquo;What an enormous tail you&rsquo;ve
got!&rdquo; says the stork to the kangaroo; &ldquo;and are those
little bits of things your forelegs? Why, you are perfectly
ridiculous.&rdquo; The kangaroo replies: &ldquo;Silly bird! my form
is perfect, and my beautiful tail is a wonder in itself, for
it helps me to take my immense leaps. Go away to your
swamp, and hide your own long sticks of legs, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty well on both sides,&rdquo; thinks Tiny; &ldquo;each
considers himself the most beautiful animal in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene IV.</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Croak! croak!&rdquo; cries a frog, squatting on the bank
of a stream; and the sound attracts Tiny. At the same
moment, a fish, popping his nose out of the water, exclaims,
&ldquo;Stop that horrid noise! I can&rsquo;t get my little ones to
sleep.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me about your little ones,&rdquo; says
the frog; &ldquo;and why don&rsquo;t you come out of the water if
you&rsquo;ve anything to say? But you&rsquo;ve no legs: you&rsquo;ve
nothing to stand upon: you are an imperfect creature.&rdquo;
The fish rejoins, &ldquo;As for you, you only hop; and when you
are in the water, why don&rsquo;t you swim gracefully, like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next Tiny alights on a terrace in a garden, where she
sees a pretty white cat. Tiny calls, &ldquo;Puss, puss!&rdquo; when
immediately out pops from among some cabbages a pert
young hare. &ldquo;Did you call?&rdquo; he inquires. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
says the cat contemptuously, &ldquo;are you Puss?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,
indeed, I am called Puss by a great many people.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,
where is your tail, if you are a cat?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tail! pooh!
what does a tail matter? Look at my fine long ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like the others,&rdquo; thinks Tiny, as she flies away;
&ldquo;always quarrelling; and always praising themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here we have an ostrich and a toucan. I think Tiny
must have flown a long way to meet with these strange
birds: but she finds that they are quarrelling like all the
rest. The toucan is mocking the ostrich, because, with all
its feathers, it cannot fly; and the ostrich laughs at the
toucan for its enormous beak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t all find fault with each other so
much,&rdquo; Tiny begins to think; &ldquo;I am sure the ostrich is very
beautiful, and I daresay the toucan has some good qualities,
though his nose is rather ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tiny must have flown to a colder country, for here
are a penguin and an eagle. &ldquo;A nice cool breeze here!&rdquo;
says the penguin to Tiny, as he flaps his little wings,
which look like leather. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your time in such
company, little girl,&rdquo; says the eagle; &ldquo;that half-bird, half-fish
is a disgrace to the family of birds, of which I am
king.&rdquo; &ldquo;I may be humble and ugly,&rdquo; rejoins the penguin,
&ldquo;but he is a bird of prey, without kindness or pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eagle looks so fierce at this retort that Tiny thinks
it wise to fly away.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Scene VIII.</span></h3>
<p>Tiny remembers now that the fairy had said her wings
would last only till sunset, so she thinks it is time to
fly towards home; for the sun is getting low already.
You see, they are fairy wings, so she can fly just as
fast as she pleases; and in a few minutes she alights in
the wood, near the spot she had started from.</p>
<p>The first thing she sees, close to her in the long grass,
is a handsome grasshopper. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, dear?&rdquo; chirps
he. &ldquo;I am very glad to see you, for I am bored to death
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
with the conversation of this stupid mole.&rdquo; As he speaks,
he points out to Tiny the mole&rsquo;s nose just peeping out of
a molehill. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;instead of being
like me, instead of having bright sparkling eyes, and wearing
a splendid green coat, all over gold, he is a very poor
creature, with scarcely any eyes at all; and he spends his
time almost always under ground, so of course he knows
nothing, and is very dull company.&rdquo; &ldquo;What good do <i>you</i>
do, with your green coat and gilding?&rdquo; replies the mole.
&ldquo;You do nothing but chirp, while I devour the vermin that
would eat up the roots of the corn. So that, although
buried, I am useful to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly the mole has the best of the argument there,&rdquo;
thinks Tiny. At that moment the sun goes down: Tiny&rsquo;s
wings drop off on to the ground, and at once shrivel up
and disappear; she recovers, too, her natural size. Then
she sees her mother&rsquo;s cottage through the trees, and a
candle just lighted is burning in the window.</p>
<p>As she walks towards it, she talks to herself as if she
were somebody else. &ldquo;Now, Miss Tiny,&rdquo; she begins, and
she touches her own breast with the point of her finger as
she speaks,&mdash;&ldquo;now, Miss Tiny, let us think a little. The
good fairy told you you should learn a lesson and grow
wise. Let us see what you have learnt. All these creatures
are more or less conceited, and, just because they
are so, they are always quarrelling; and how disagreeable
and ridiculous they make themselves, to be sure! I wonder
if Miss Tiny is as disagreeable and absurd as they are?
If she is, she won&rsquo;t be so any more. From this day, she
will always try to see whatever there is that&rsquo;s good and
nice and pretty in everybody else, and make the most of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiny keeps to her resolution; the consequence is, that
everybody loves her, and she is happier than ever she has
been before.</p>

<h3>TEN LEPERS HEALED.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-320do.jpg" alt="O" width="96" height="138" />
</div>
<p>One of the most common faults&mdash;or
rather, I should say, one of the most
common sins&mdash;that we meet with in
the world, is that of ingratitude. Some
are ungrateful from pride or conceit,
thinking that the kindnesses or services
of others are due to them of right.
But most people are ungrateful simply
from thoughtlessness: yet this very
thoughtlessness&mdash;the want of thought
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
for others&mdash;has its root in what is the foundation of all
faults&mdash;selfishness.</p>
<p>Even in dumb creatures&mdash;from whom, by the way, we
may often learn good lessons&mdash;we seldom see ingratitude.
If you are kind and gentle to a dog or cat, a horse or
bird, it will be thankful, and generally manage in its own
fashion to make you understand its gratitude. My darling
children, never be ungrateful! Be grateful to God first
of all&mdash;be grateful to God for everything. Be grateful to
your father and mother; and be grateful also to all those
who show so many kindnesses to you. Never forget to
thank them both with heart and lip.</p>
<p>I am going to tell you to-day of an instance of man&rsquo;s
ingratitude: not that of man to man, but of ingratitude to
our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We are told by St. Luke that,&mdash;&ldquo;It came to pass as
Jesus went to Jerusalem, He passed through the midst of
Samaria and Galilee. And as He entered into a certain
village, there met Him ten men that were lepers, which
stood afar off; and they lifted up their voices, and said,
&lsquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.&rsquo; And when He saw
them, He said unto them, &lsquo;Go, show yourselves unto the
priests.&rsquo; And it came to pass that, as they went, they were
cleansed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must tell you that this leprosy, with which these poor
people were afflicted, was a terrible disease common
among the Jews at that time. It was a disease of the
skin, which was hereditary, and also was caught by
contagion. Hence those afflicted with it were prohibited
by strict laws from associating with other people. They
might not enter the walled cities at all, and in the villages
they were obliged to live apart from the other inhabitants.
You see these lepers &ldquo;stood afar off&rdquo; while they cried out
to Jesus for mercy.</p>
<p>We must suppose that before anyone recovering from
the leprosy was allowed to associate with his fellow-citizens,
he had to go before the priests, that they should
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
pronounce him cured; and this explains the injunction of
our Saviour&mdash;&ldquo;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&rdquo; The
lepers had faith, and turned at once to obey. They had
scarcely moved a step when the change in their condition
seems to have taken place; and we may imagine their joy
and surprise, on looking at each other, to see the ghastly
and loathsome hue of the leprous skin change for the
bloom and freshness of health. But now we come to the
sad instance of ingratitude.</p>
<p>St. Luke goes on to tell us&mdash;still speaking of the lepers:&mdash;&ldquo;And
one of them, when he saw that he was healed,
turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God; and
fell down on his face at Jesus&rsquo; feet, giving Him thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we find, out of these ten, one only showed himself
grateful, and thought, before aught else, of glorifying
God, and giving thanks to Jesus. The other nine, in
their joy at the blessing which had just been bestowed
upon them, forgot the Bestower of that blessing. They
hastened on, thinking only of their own good fortune, and
eager to make known their recovery to the priests, that
they might be restored to communication with their fellow
men.</p>
<p>Our Saviour only remarked upon this instance of ingratitude:&mdash;&ldquo;Were
there not ten cleansed? but where are
the nine?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c99">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3><span class="sc">Charlie.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-323di.jpg" alt="I" width="65" height="137" />
</div>
<p>I made the acquaintance of my little friend
Charlie under very unusual and startling circumstances.
When I saw him for the first
time he was situated as you see him in the
picture. I saw a lad about thirteen years of
age, clinging desperately, for very life, to
the topmast of a sunken ship in the British
Channel. I will tell you how it happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>I must go back nearly twenty years;&mdash;indeed, I ought to
explain that Charlie was a little friend of mine a long time
ago; now he&rsquo;s a grown-up man. Well, twenty years ago
I was not very old myself; but my sister, who is some
years older than I am, was already married, and her husband
was very fond of yachting. They lived, during a
great part of the year, in the Isle of Wight, and there I
often used to go to stay with them.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Swallow&rdquo;&mdash;that was the name of my brother-in-law&rsquo;s
yacht&mdash;was a beautiful boat, and many happy hours
have I passed on board her, as she skimmed merrily over
the sparkling water. I delighted to sit on deck, watching
the fishing-boats as they rode bravely from wave to wave;
or sometimes wondering at some large ship, as it passed
by, on which men live for weeks and months without ever
touching land. We used to sail long distances, and occasionally
be out for several days and nights together. My
brother-in-law&rsquo;s skipper could tell me what country almost
every vessel that we saw was bound for. Some were sailing
to climates where the heat is so great that our most
sultry summer in England is comparatively cold; others
were off northward, perhaps whale-fishing, where they
would see huge icebergs, and hear the growling of the
polar bears.</p>
<p>We were taking our last cruise of the season: it was
already near the end of October, and the weather was
becoming stormy. Passing out of the Solent into the
Channel, we found the sea much rougher than we expected;
and as night came on it blew a regular gale.
The wind and sea roared, the rain poured down in torrents,
and the night seemed to me to be the darkest I had ever
known. But on board the &ldquo;Swallow&rdquo; we had no fear;
we trusted to the seamanship of our skipper and the
goodness of our vessel, and went to bed with minds as
free from fear as if the sea were smooth and the sky
clear.</p>
<p>I awoke just as dawn was breaking, dressed quickly, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
throwing a water-proof cloak over me, popped my head up
the companion-ladder to see how things looked. The old
skipper was on deck; he had not turned in during the
night. I wished him good-morning, and he remarked, in
return, that the wind was going down, he thought. Looking
at the sea, I observed two or three large fragments of
wood floating near, and they attracted his notice at the
same moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has there been a wreck, captain?&rdquo; I asked, with a
feeling of awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about what it is, miss,&rdquo; answered the old seaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the people are drowned?&rdquo; I inquired
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Captain Bounce, casting, as I thought,
rather a contemptuous glance at me, &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t in
general live under water, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they may have had boats,&rdquo; I said meekly.
&ldquo;Do you think boats could have reached the shore in such
a storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the old captain, &ldquo;they might have
had boats and they mightn&rsquo;t; and the boats, supposing
they had &rsquo;em, might have lived through the storm, and
at the same time they mightn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not giving me much information, and I
thought to myself that my friend the skipper did not seem
so much inclined for a chat as usual; I turned to look at
the sea in search of more pieces of wreck, when I discovered,
in the distance, a dark speck rising out of the
water. I pointed it out to the skipper at once, who took
his glass out of his pocket, and, after looking through it for
a moment, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something floating there, and a man clinging
to it, as I&rsquo;m alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, my brother-in-law came on deck, and also
took a look through the telescope. Then he, the captain,
and every sailor on board became eager and excited; you
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
would have thought it was some dear friend of each whose
life was to be saved. The yacht was headed in the direction
of the object, the boat was quickly lowered, the captain
himself, with four sailors, jumping into it; and, in
another minute, they caught in their arms a poor little
exhausted and fainting boy, as he dropped from the mast
of a large sunken ship. We could now distinguish the
tops of all the three masts appearing above the waves; for
the sea was not deep, and the ship had settled down in an
upright position.</p>
<p>Poor Charlie Standish was soon in the cabin of the
yacht, and after swallowing some champagne he revived
sufficiently to tell us his story. The sunken ship was the
&ldquo;Melbourne,&rdquo; bound for Australia, and this was Charlie&rsquo;s
first voyage as a midshipman on board. During the darkness
of the night she had been run into by a large homeward-bound
merchantman of the same class. She sank
within an hour of the collision. In the scramble for the
boats Charlie thought he had but little chance for finding
a place; and as the ship filled, and kept sinking deeper in
the water, an instinct of self-preservation led him to climb
into the rigging. Then up he went, higher and higher,
even to the topmast; and at last, when the vessel went
down all at once, he found himself, to his inexpressible
relief, still above the surface.</p>
<p>What most astonished us all was that a boy so young
should have been able to hold on for more than an hour to
a slippery mast, exposed to the fury of the wind, and
within reach, even, of the lashing waves. We sailed home
at once to the Isle of Wight, and wrote to the boy&rsquo;s mother,
a widow living in London, to tell her of his safety. The
boy himself stayed with us two or three days. My brother-in-law
took a great fancy to him; he has watched his
career, and seen him at intervals, ever since. Charlie
Standish is now a chief mate on board a great merchantman
of the same class as the &ldquo;Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The Lion is called the king of beasts,
because he is the most courageous,
the strongest, and the grandest-looking
of all beasts. The picture represents
a great lion and his family; you
see he has just caught a poor little
gazelle, of which herds are found in
the plains of Africa. And that, as I
daresay you know, is also the country
of the lions.</p>
<p>Lions belong to what is called the cat tribe of animals,
as do also tigers and leopards. The members of this tribe
are remarkable for their powerful jaw, large fangs, the
quickness and grace of their movements, and for the manner
in which the sharp hooked claws of the feet are drawn
back when not in use, and thrust forward when needed for
action.</p>
<p>The colour of the lion is a tawny yellow, lighter on the
under parts of the body, and darker above. The ears are
almost black, and there is a tuft of black hair at the tip of
the tail. When full-grown, the male lion has a thick,
shaggy mane of long hair, which falls from the neck and
shoulders, covering the throat and breast. He measures
some four feet in height at the shoulder, and about eleven
feet in length, including the tail. These measurements,
however, are only applicable to the animals which have
lived in freedom in their native land, with their limbs unshackled,
and spirits unbroken.</p>
<p>The lioness is a smaller animal than her mate, the difference
in size appearing greater than it really is, because
she is without the shaggy mane, which makes the
lion seem so grand and imposing. But though smaller,
she is quite as terrible as the lion; and if she has cubs to
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
look after and protect, she is a fearful enemy to any who
cross her path.</p>
<p>I think it would amuse you to hear an anecdote of a revengeful
lioness, which I lately read. The gentleman, who
relates the story, was out with a party of hunters in Southern
Africa, in search of elephants. They had not had much
sport, and as they were going to encamp for a day, this
gentleman thought he would ride off alone to a patch of
jungle or wood not far away, which appeared likely to
harbour wild beasts. He discovered no sign of elephants,
but he found a new footprint made by a lion. Now he had
never shot a lion, and had a great ambition to do so; accordingly,
he followed the lion&rsquo;s track, which of course was
very brave of him, but, I must say, I think, very rash.
After a little while he came suddenly upon the savage
beast, and luckily shot him dead at the first shot.</p>
<p>Having achieved this exploit, he was anxious to carry back
the skin with him as a trophy; and therefore set to work to
skin the dead beast, which, it seems to me, must have been
a most horrible business. This operation took a long time,
and when accomplished, our friend the hunter found great
difficulty in persuading his horse to carry the skin. Horses
have a great horror of lions, and the poor animal probably
did not feel sure that the skin alone could do him no
harm.</p>
<p>At last all was satisfactorily arranged, and the hunter
started to return to the encampment; but so much time
had been lost, that before he had gone far, night began to
close in, and he thought it best to bivouac where he was
till daylight. There was a stream of water close by; and
he had with him a blanket, a flask of brandy, and a box of
matches. He took the precaution also, before it was quite
dark, to shoot a guinea-fowl for his supper. Then, collecting
a quantity of dry wood, he piled it up in a circle,
leaving space enough inside for himself, his horse, and the
skin. Setting fire to the wood, he considered himself safe
from any attack of wild beasts within this magic circle of
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
fire, and made himself comfortable for the night. He
cooked and ate his supper, and then, lying down by the
side of his horse, soon began to doze.</p>
<p>Presently he was disturbed by a loud snort from his
horse. He rose up, and kicking the burning wood together
with the heel of his boot, made a brighter blaze, and distinctly
saw the head of an old lioness looking through the
surrounding bushes. She was gone in an instant, but you
may be sure the hunter did not go to sleep again. He
suspected at once that she was the widow of the lion he
had killed, and that she had followed the scent of his skin
to be revenged upon his murderer.</p>
<p>Our hunter made his fire burn as brightly as he could,
and remained upon the watch for the lioness. He thought
he could see her again among the bushes, and seizing a
piece of burning wood, threw it at her; then he detected
her slinking away into the darkness. He did not fire, for
he saw too imperfectly to be sure of his aim. Not long
afterwards he suddenly heard a terrific roar, and at the
same moment some large body flew through the air close
to him. Then followed a crash, and the hunter saw his
poor horse knocked down, as if shot, beneath the weight of
the lioness, who stood on him, tearing at him and growling.
The hunter fired: the first shot wounded her, the
second killed; but she had so far revenged the lion&rsquo;s death
that she had killed the horse.</p>
<p>The hunter now had her skin as well as the lion&rsquo;s, which
must have been a satisfaction to him. He set to work to
skin her at once, and then buried both skins in the ground
that they might not be eaten or damaged by prowling
animals, while he trudged back on foot to the encampment.
In the afternoon he returned in a waggon, and fetched
away both skins, which he kept as trophies.</p>
<p>My own experience of a lioness is of a very different
sort to this, as my acquaintance with either lions or lionesses
has been made only at the Zoological gardens. But
I remember a few years ago there was a dear old lioness
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
there, who had five little cubs; and I can only say her kindness
and tenderness to her young ones would have afforded
a good example to many mothers.</p>
<p>I will tell you another anecdote about a lion. It is
related of a lion of the Zoological gardens, who died there
of inflammation of the lungs many years ago. Sir Edwin
Landseer was then just rising into fame as a painter of
animals, and a friend of his suggested to the manager of
the gardens, that the dead lion should be sent to Sir Edwin,
in case he might like to paint it.</p>
<p>So one morning, just at daylight, (this is how the story
is told) the artist was awakened by a knocking at his bedroom
door. He called out to know who was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;have you ordered a
lion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordered a what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lion, sir; have you ordered a lion? because there&rsquo;s
a dead one just come to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said the great painter, &ldquo;take him in:
I&rsquo;ll be down directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dressing hurriedly, he went downstairs, and beheld the
enormous beast stretched at full length upon the floor of
his studio. The artist quickly arranged his palette, and
painted a picture of a lion lying dead in the desert. The
picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849, and
added greatly to the artist&rsquo;s fame.</p>

</div>
<p>Little Tiny had a sad habit of
tasting everything that came in her
way. This was because she was so
greedy; and it was very naughty
too, because she used to take things
that had not been given to her. At
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
last she had a lesson, which I am going to tell you
of, and I think it almost cured her of her bad habit.</p>
<p>One day Tiny&rsquo;s mother was in the kitchen, preparing
some nice dish, and she said to her little
girl,&mdash;&ldquo;Run into the back kitchen, dear, and bring
me a lemon; you will find some upon the shelf.&rdquo;
When Tiny found herself alone in the back kitchen,
she looked about to see if there was anything she
could taste. On a shelf she saw a number of jars,
which looked as if they contained jam, or preserves,
or something of that sort; so she placed
a stool, and standing on tip-toe upon it, chose
a pretty little jar, which she took down. It contained
some yellow powder: she put her fingers
into the powder without hesitation, and then put
them into her mouth. Bah! it was mustard. Crying
and spluttering, she went back to her mamma,
who simply said,&mdash;&ldquo;My dear, it serves you right.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c104">AUNT TOTTY&rsquo;S PETS:</h2>
<h3><span class="sc">Jacquot.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-339dh.jpg" alt="J" width="78" height="154" />
</div>
<p>Here is another of Aunt Totty&rsquo;s stories
about her pet animals. I shall tell it to my
little readers as nearly as I can in her own
words; and they must fancy Aunt Totty
seated in the midst of her little nephews
and nieces, who are all ready to listen.
This is how she begins:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dears, I am going to give you
an account of a pet I had whose name was
Jacquot. I daresay you think from the
name it must have been a monkey or a
parrot. No such thing! it was a great brown bear, and
this is how I made his acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not more than nine years old, and was travelling
with my papa and mamma, and my brother, who was two
or three years older than myself. We were making a tour
in Switzerland, and stopped for a few days at a town
of which I forget the name now; for you may suppose it
was a great many years ago. However, what I <i>do</i> remember
is that a fair was being held in the town at the
time, and that is how it happened that the bear was
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the morning after our arrival I came down early,&mdash;as
I thought, before anyone else of the party&mdash;and seated
myself at the open window of our sitting-room in the
hotel. As I sat there watching all that was going on
outside, I saw my brother cross the courtyard of the hotel,
coming out from a long low range of buildings on the
other side of it. A minute afterwards he entered the
room, and coming up to me, said with an air of mystery,&mdash;&lsquo;Totty,
I want to show you something: come with me
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
before mamma and papa are down; you&rsquo;ll see something
curious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; I inquired, feeling quite excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you what it is; but come along and see,&rsquo;
answered my brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he spoke, he led me downstairs. We crossed the
courtyard hand in hand, and entered the stables of the
hotel. I could not help looking about rather nervously, as
he led me past a number of horses and mules&mdash;keeping
always, however, at a safe distance from their heels&mdash;till
we came to the last stall of all. In a corner of this, I perceived
a huge ragged hairy ball, but what it was I could
not at first imagine. I saw that a strong chain attached it
to a ring in the wall; then I discovered that it was some
living creature, for its sides rose and fell with the breath as
it slept. A man, who was lying on some straw close by,
seeing my brother and me, rose up, and said in French,&mdash;&lsquo;You
need not be afraid, he won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rsquo; Then
patting the creature with his hand, he added,&mdash;&lsquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t hurt the young lady, would you, Jacquot?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ball uncurled itself, growled, and rose upon four
legs. It was a bear: but the saddest-looking, the thinnest,
and most ragged you can imagine. It had twenty
scars on different parts of its body, and one ear was almost
torn away. I must have looked shocked and distressed,
for the man seemed to understand my thoughts, and
said,&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, well! what can you expect? poor Jacquot
is not happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he went on to tell us the bear&rsquo;s history. It
appeared that he was himself only the keeper or attendant
of the bear, not the owner. He told us that Jacquot was
born in the Pyr&egrave;nean mountains: he was caught when
quite a baby, and received an excellent education, being
able to dance and perform every trick a bear can learn; he
was perfect also in point of docility. At one year of age,
his education being considered complete, he had been sold
to the man who was still his master. This man, at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
time he made the purchase, was the owner also of other
animals. Jacquot&rsquo;s first companions were a camel, two
monkeys, and a red and blue parrot. One of the monkeys
passed the greater part of his time on the bear&rsquo;s back, the
other monkey and the parrot on the back of the camel.
But they were not a happy family: the monkeys and parrot
bit and scratched, and generally tyrannised over, the
patient camel and the good-natured bear.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-341.jpg" alt="Dog and monkey" width="500" height="358" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of these animals used to take them about
in a caravan from place to place, to exhibit them; but he
was not kind to them, or did not treat them properly, for
the camel, one monkey, and the parrot died; and when I
made the acquaintance of Jacquot they had lately been
replaced by a small leopard. So that the collection consisted
then of a bear, a monkey, and a leopard, the latter
being kept in a strong-wooden cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as the man finished speaking, a monkey jumped
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
down from a manger, and seized upon some cabbage
leaves which the man, while talking to us, had given poor
Jacquot. The bear, who was enjoying his little bit of
greenmeat, objected to part with it; whereupon the monkey,
looking like a little fiend, seized upon an old saucepan
which lay near, and belaboured the poor bear cruelly
upon the head and nose. Not content with this, it jumped
upon the bear&rsquo;s back, and bit and tore the poor creature,
until the man took up a whip; at the sight of which the
savage monkey quickly made off into its manger again.
From that moment I hated the monkey, and loved the poor,
patient, oppressed, ill-used bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the next few days I used to pay a visit to
Jacquot whenever I could get my brother to take me into
the stable; and on such occasions I always took him a
present of fruit or cakes. More than once, also, I saw him
performing in the fair, and then it always seemed to me
that he looked out of the corner of his little eye as if he
recognised me. There was a knowing twinkle in his eye
which seemed to say,&mdash;&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t appear to be friends in
public, but we have our pleasant little secret interviews for
all that.&rsquo; It went to my heart to see how the patient creature
was knocked about and ill-treated by his cruel master,
who always acted himself as showman. Poor Jacquot
danced and went through his different performances hour
after hour, with nothing but blows for his reward. He was
the principal performer: the monkey was not very clever,
and did not do much; while the only trick that the leopard
had been taught was to jump through a hoop, which was
thrust into his cage between the bars. When not doing
this he only walked backwards and forwards in his cage, to
be looked at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening I had some nice cakes, which mamma
had given me from the dessert after dinner, to take to
Jacquot. I looked about for my brother to go with me
into the stable, but not finding him, at last, after some
hesitation, I ventured to go alone. The coast was quite
<span class="pb" id="Page_341">341</span>
clear; there seemed to be nobody about. I passed by the
horses and mules, and went on to the last stall, which was
Jacquot&rsquo;s habitation.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-343.jpg" alt="Leopard" width="500" height="209" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;He welcomed me with a friendly grunt, and while he
was munching his cakes, for which he seemed very grateful,
I happened to look through an open door which led into
a room beyond the stable. This room was probably intended
as a harness room, but I knew that in it the leopard
was kept. There was his cage, too, standing on the ground,
just in the place where I had seen it before; but I noticed,
to my inexpressible astonishment, that the cage was empty.
I did not observe, or do not remember, whether the cage
door was open or the cage was broken; but the conviction
on my mind at once was that the leopard had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a corner of the stable was a heap of clean straw, on
which the keeper of the animals, Auguste,&mdash;the man who
had told us the history of Jacquot&mdash;was accustomed to lie
down; probably it served for his bed at night. While I
was wondering what could have become of the leopard, and
beginning to feel very frightened, I heard a rustling sound,
and saw the handsome, wicked-looking head of the creature
peep from beneath the straw; then slowly it crept out
altogether, its eyes glaring at me, and showing its teeth
the while. It was just going to spring when my friend
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">342</span>
Jacquot saved my life. As I stood immovable from fear,
Jacquot stepped in front of me, the length of his chain just
allowing it; and there he stood up, exactly as a man might
have done, to defend me. He gave a tremendous growl
as the leopard sprang upon him. I saw no more, but ran
off as fast as I could.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-344.jpg" alt="Muzzled bear" width="500" height="761" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">343</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the courtyard I met Auguste, who had heard the
bear growl, and was running to see what had happened. I
afterwards learnt that he had only been able to liberate
poor Jacquot and secure the leopard by striking the latter
on the head with an iron bar, which he kept always handy
for emergencies of the kind. The creature was stunned by
the blow and restored to its cage, but both animals were
very much hurt in the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the question arose, how was Jacquot to be rewarded
for having saved my life? My father said at once
that he should like to buy the bear, so as to save it from
further ill-treatment by its master, the monkey, or the
leopard. But when we had him what were we to do with
him? He could not be taken about with us like a pet dog.
Then I proposed that it should be bought from its present
owner, and made a present to Auguste, who, I felt sure,
would always treat it kindly. This plan was carried out;
and before we left Switzerland I had the satisfaction of
knowing that Jacquot was earning a good living for itself,
and for a kind master, by its accomplishments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years afterwards I was staying at the house of
some French friends of ours near Versailles, when one of
the children&mdash;for there was a large family&mdash;ran into the
drawing-room, looking very excited, to say that there was
a wonderful performing bear, which had come into the
garden, and they had now got it in the nursery, which
opened on to the garden. The bear was doing the most
extraordinary things, the child said, and would we come to
see it? We elders of the party went off to the nursery
immediately, for it sounded alarming to have a bear playing
with the children. As we entered, I at once recognised
in the bear&rsquo;s master, who was standing in a corner of the
room, and looking on with great pride at his bear&rsquo;s performances,
my old friend Auguste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Jacquot&rsquo;s story to my friends, and you may
be sure the bear and its master were both made much
of.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Philip and Rosa work very hard at their
lessons. They are the two oldest of a
family of seven: Philip goes to college
in the day-time, and Rosa has a daily
governess, so that in the evening they both
have lessons to prepare for the next day;
and they like to work quietly together in a
little room they call their school-room.</p>
<p>One evening Philip had been having a game with one
of his little brothers. Tommy&mdash;that was the little brother&rsquo;s
name&mdash;had had a present made to him of a bat and ball,
and Philip showed him how to play. Now Master Tommy
was so pleased with the game, that when evening came on,
and it was time for him to go in, and when Philip, too,
wanted to go to his lessons, he would not leave off. At
last Philip adopted the plan, when Tommy&rsquo;s back was
turned for a moment, of making the bat and ball disappear.
Then Tommy began to cry; and his big brother assured
him that &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; had taken the bat and ball; adding,&mdash;&ldquo;But
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
if you are a good boy he&rsquo;ll bring them back to-morrow.&rdquo;
So saying, off he went to his work in the school-room.</p>
<p>Just when Philip and Rosa had settled to their work,
with books and slates scattered upon the table, a little
figure, with knapsack on his back, and cap much too large
for him covering his head, crept quietly into the room.
They thought it best to take no notice of Master Tommy,
as then perhaps he might go away of himself; but presently,
when they were most occupied with their lessons, he suddenly
slipped some of the books from the table into his
knapsack, and taking others and a slate under his arm,
ran out of the room. At the door he turned and cried out,
&ldquo;Bogy&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em; if you good, perhaps he&rsquo;ll bring &rsquo;em
&rsquo;gain to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip and Rosa pursued, and picked up the books,
which Tommy dropped as he ran downstairs. They both
took the joke very good-naturedly. Philip declared it was
only tit for tat; and Rosa supplied Tommy with a lot of
old finery, for him to take into the nursery, that he and the
other children might amuse themselves by dressing up.</p>
<p>After all, Tommy had capital fun that evening. The
children dressed up, and fancied themselves all sorts of
wonderful people: kings, and queens, and fairies; judges
and generals, and I know not what.</p>

the daughter of Jairus&mdash;where He restored
a child to life; but I am now going to describe how
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
our Lord brought back to life a man who had been four
days dead.</p>
<p>In the little city of Bethany, in Jud&aelig;a, lived a family
which we are told that Jesus loved. This family consisted
of two sisters and a brother, and their names were Mary,
Martha, and Lazarus. Now Lazarus fell sick, and his
sisters sent to tell Jesus of this. The message they sent
was simply, &ldquo;Lord, he whom Thou lovest is sick.&rdquo; They
made no request, but probably they thought that the kind
and good Lord who had done so many works of mercy for
others, would come and heal their brother.</p>
<p>When Jesus received this message, He was in the
country beyond the river Jordan, about thirty miles from
Bethany, which is near Jerusalem. He had retired to a
distance from the latter city, because the priests and
Pharisees had succeeded in stirring up a portion of the
populace against Him. His reply to the messengers was
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This sickness is not unto death, but for the
glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.&rdquo;
These seemed like words of comfort for the anxious
sisters; yet they saw their brother get worse hour after
hour. The Saviour came not; and at length their brother
died.</p>
<p>And where was Jesus at the time? After receiving the
message, He &ldquo;abode two days still in the place where He
was.&rdquo; But this delay does not appear to have arisen from
any hesitation to return to the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.
He said to His disciples, at the end of the two days,
&ldquo;Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sakes that I
was not there, to the intent ye may believe: nevertheless,
let us go unto him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words appear to signify that our Saviour was
glad He had not been with Lazarus when he was ill, because
then He should have cured him, and the miracle
would not have been so wonderful as it would be now&mdash;not
so likely to increase the faith of those who beheld
it. Therefore He rejoiced that He should have to raise
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
Lazarus from death to life instead of curing him of sickness.</p>
<p>The disciples attempted to dissuade Christ from returning
so near to Jerusalem, but finding Him resolved, they
declared their willingness to accompany Him, and they all
departed together into the land of Jud&aelig;a. As they approached
Bethany, Martha, hearing that the Lord was
coming, went out to meet Him, while Mary remained in
the house. As soon as Martha met Jesus, she thought,
doubtless, of all the people He had so mercifully healed by
a touch of His hand or a word from His mouth, and said
to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had
not died.&rdquo; Then added immediately afterwards, &ldquo;But I
know that even now, whatever Thou wilt ask of God, God
will give it Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words of Martha&rsquo;s prove how strong her faith
was. And Jesus answered her, saying, &ldquo;Thy brother shall
rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She does not seem to have felt sure that this promise
was meant in the sense of restoring Lazarus to life; but
what followed is best related in the words of St. John, who
tells us:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha saith unto Him, &lsquo;I know that he shall rise again
in the resurrection at the last day.&rsquo; Jesus said unto her, &lsquo;I
am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever
liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou
this?&rsquo; She saith unto Him, &lsquo;Yea, Lord: I believe that
Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come
into the world.&rsquo; And when she had so said, she went her
way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, &lsquo;The
Master is come, and calleth for thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the custom among the Jews, when anybody died,
for the friends and neighbours of the bereaved family to
gather round the remaining members of it, and mourn
with them, or endeavour to console them. Mary was
surrounded by friends when Martha returned to her, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_352">352</span>
said, &ldquo;The Master is come.&rdquo; St. John goes on as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came
unto Him. Now Jesus was not yet come unto the town,
but was in that place where Martha met Him. The Jews
then which were with her in the house, and comforted her,
when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went
out, followed her, saying, &lsquo;She goeth unto the grave, to
weep there.&rsquo; Then when Mary was come where Jesus was,
and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him,
&lsquo;Lord, if Thou hads&rsquo;t been here my brother had not died.&rsquo;
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also
weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and
was troubled; and said, &lsquo;Where have ye laid him?&rsquo; They
said unto Him, &lsquo;Lord, come and see.&rsquo; Jesus wept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ, the Son of God, wept with the mourners.
Although He knew He should raise Lazarus from the
dead, He shed tears at the sight of human grief.</p>
<p>They came to the grave. It was a sepulchre hewn out
of the rock, and a large stone had been rolled against the
entrance. Jesus desired that this stone should be rolled
away. Then Martha reminded Him that Lazarus had been
dead four days. She said this because in hot countries
like Jud&aelig;a bodies decompose rapidly after death. But
Christ replied,&mdash;&ldquo;Said I not unto thee that if thou
wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone was removed. Jesus first lifted up His eyes,
and prayed, then He cried in a loud voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Lazarus,
come forth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man who had been dead four days came forth,
all wrapped in his grave-clothes, and his face bound about
with a napkin. Those who stood round and beheld this
miracle, were too astounded to approach Lazarus, until
Christ said,&mdash;&ldquo;Loose him, and let him go.&rdquo; St. John
adds:&mdash;&ldquo;Many of the Jews which came with Mary, and
had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c109">SOME OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS:</h2>
<h3><span class="sc">Janey.</span></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-356dt.jpg" alt="T" width="155" height="162" />
</div>
<p>The name of my little friend,
whose picture you see on the
last page, is Janey; and I
will tell you how I became
acquainted with her.</p>
<p>One very cold day in
December last year, just
before Christmas time, I was
walking rather briskly in a
London street near my own
house, with a certain pair of
little pattering feet trotting along beside me, and a certain
pair of bright blue eyes looking alternately up to my face
and at the brilliantly decorated shops. Now and then we
stopped to look in at the windows of the toy-shops, and
see the beautiful toys, and other pretty things displayed
there. And now and then we did still better, for we went
in at the glass doors, and mingling with a host of other
merry Christmas folk, bought some of the pretty things
we had been looking at from the outside. Both Lily and
I would come out of the shops laden with such a number
of parcels&mdash;such a load of dolls and horses, balls and
musical instruments, that it was a wonder and a puzzle to
ourselves how we contrived to carry them all. I think my
little Lily&rsquo;s slender arms grew stronger and longer for the
occasion. Once, too, we went into a pastrycook&rsquo;s, and
came out with still an additional parcel or two: these were
intended for the little ones at home.</p>
<p>My Lily and I had lately made several expeditions of
this kind in the service of a certain giant tree at home.
For a long time this tree seemed insatiable: the greedy
<span class="pb" id="Page_355">355</span>
branches never had enough, though every day new ornaments,
or toys, or trinkets of some sort were hung upon
them. But to-day&rsquo;s was to be our last expedition; we
needed only a few toys to fill up some gaps near the foot
of our great Christmas tree.</p>
<p>We had just made up our minds to go into no more
shops, but hurry home with the purchases we had made,
when, in turning a corner, Lily ran up against a poor little
girl scarcely bigger than herself, though probably about
eight years old. The little girl had on a dress with short
sleeves, although it was so cold; she had a little three-cornered
grey woollen shawl upon her shoulders, and a
torn straw hat upon her head. This little girl was Janey;
and my Lily, who was walking very fast, had almost
knocked her over.</p>
<p>As the two children recovered from the shock, I saw
Janey turn her pretty brown eyes wistfully towards the
parcels of toys and sugar-plums we were carrying; when
Lily, touched at the sight of the forlorn little girl, suddenly
held out half-a-crown, which had been clutched in her
hand ever since we had been out. This half-crown had
been given to her that morning by her god-father, and she
had brought it out to spend it, but had not done so. I
thought it rather much to give to a strange child; but I
said nothing, as the girl had already got the money safe in
her poor little cold red hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my own, you know, mamma dear,&rdquo; pleaded my
Lily, perhaps reading my thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; I replied, as I watched the expression of
delight in both the children&rsquo;s faces: one delighted at
receiving, the other at giving the present.</p>
<p>The strange child murmured some words of thanks, and
we continued on our way. We had not gone far, however,
when I discovered that I had lost my purse, and feeling
sure that I had left it on the counter in the last shop we
had been to, I and Lily began to retrace our steps as
quickly as we could. We had not gone far when we came
<span class="pb" id="Page_356">356</span>
in sight of the little girl again. She was standing in front
of a toy shop, as you see her in the picture; she held the
half-crown in her hand, and was glancing, sometimes at
the shop window, sometimes at some oranges on a fruit
stall in the street, seeming undecided what to buy. Just
before we reached her, however, she appeared to have
made up her mind, and without entering the shop, she
trotted briskly on in front of us.</p>
<p>Presently we saw her walk into a baker&rsquo;s shop; we
passed it, but had not gone far beyond, before she overtook
us, walking very fast, and carrying two large loaves
under her shawl. Then I stopped her, and asked where
she was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am taking mother this
bread for our little ones: they are so hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t buy yourself a toy, nor even an orange
then?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But you have still money enough to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have lots left out of what the little lady gave me,
but I would rather, please, take it all home to mother.
She would give us toys if she could, but it is hard for her
to give us bread, and I know she will spend the money
better than I can. I did stop at the toy shop window,
ma&rsquo;am, but I am very glad I didn&rsquo;t buy anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was Christmas time!&mdash;the time, above all others
in the year, when we should help each other, in remembrance
of Him who came to us one Christmas night, and
living on the earth among the poor, taught us by His precept
and example to love and succour all our poorer brethren.</p>
<p>We walked with little Janey to see her mother, and her
home, which was very near; and I think the readers of
&ldquo;Wide-awake&rdquo; will be glad to hear that Janey, her
mother, and the little ones have not suffered from want of
bread since that day. Besides, on Christmas day itself
they had a real Christmas dinner, with roast beef and
plum-pudding, and oranges; and good little Janey had
some toys given to her into the bargain.</p>

<p>Cissy and Lily are feeding a little tame
sparrow. The poor bird had fallen out
of its nest, and the gardener picked it
up, and gave it to the children. The
little creature sits on Cissy&rsquo;s finger,
while Lily feeds it with bread and milk.
It is getting quite tame, puts its little
head on one side, and looks at Lily out
of its pretty bright eye. The children
<span class="pb" id="Page_361">361</span>
have had it some days: it can fly a little now, but shows
no wish at present to fly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mother of it,&rdquo; says Lily, &ldquo;tos I feed it.&rdquo;
Then she adds, after considering a moment: &ldquo;Cissy can
be father if she likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cissy, aged nine years, smiles at this remark, and says,&mdash;&ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, my dear
child; I can be aunt or grandmamma: Johnny can be
father, if he likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny is marching up and down the room with a gun
over his shoulder. He is two years old, and likes to be
one thing at a time, so he answers in a gruff voice,&mdash;&ldquo;No,
me tan&rsquo;t: Donny soldar; tan&rsquo;t be father now;&rdquo; and he
continues his march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call it Tommy,&rdquo; says Lily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teddy&rsquo;s a prettier name,&rdquo; suggests Cissy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t call it Teddy,&rdquo; rejoins Lily; &ldquo;peoples &rsquo;ill think
he&rsquo;s a donkey.&rdquo; Lily once knew a donkey who had that
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!&rdquo; cries Cissy in a
teazing way. Whereupon Lily, who, I am sorry to say, is
very short-tempered, raises her little hand, and brings it
down smartly on Cissy&rsquo;s face. A skirmish takes place:
the sparrow flies off to a distant part of the room; and
mamma, coming in at the moment, finds voices raised,
tears flowing, and red and angry faces.</p>
<p>After hearing what each has to say, mamma thinks that
both children have been very naughty, and she tells them
to make it up. Neither will say that she is sorry. Then
mamma looks very grave, and tells the children how we
ought always to ask pardon when we have done wrong.</p>
<p>At last peace is restored: the little girls kiss each other
and are quite happy again. Then Cissy says:&mdash;&ldquo;Sometimes
people had better not ask pardon, mamma dear.
Don&rsquo;t you remember Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s story in
&lsquo;What the Moon saw?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt very much, dear, if there is any story of Hans
<span class="pb" id="Page_362">362</span>
Christian Andersen&rsquo;s which teaches us we ought not to ask
pardon, when we have done wrong: I don&rsquo;t know which
you can be thinking of. &lsquo;What the Moon saw&rsquo; is a collection
of little stories, one of which is supposed to be
related every evening by the moon to a poor artist, who
was fond of looking at her from his window. The moon
relates to him something she has seen on the world every
evening. But, Cissy dear, get the book, and read us the
story you are thinking of; it is sure to be amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-364.jpg" alt="Man opening door, and child" width="500" height="502" />
</div>
<p>The book is on the table, for Cissy has been reading it
to-day. She takes it up, and begins at once to read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">WHAT THE MOON SAW.
<br /><span class="small">SECOND EVENING.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; said the moon to me, &ldquo;I looked down
upon a small court-yard surrounded on all sides by houses.
In the court-yard sat a clucking hen with eleven chickens;
<span class="pb" id="Page_363">363</span>
and a pretty little girl was running and jumping round
them. The hen was frightened, and screamed, and spread
out her wings over the little brood. Then the girl&rsquo;s father
came out and scolded her; and I glided away and thought
no more of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this evening, only a few minutes ago, I looked
down into the same court-yard. Everything was quite
quiet. But presently the little girl came forth again, crept
quietly to the hen-house, pushed back the bolts, and slipped
into the apartment of the hen and chickens. They cried
out loudly, and came fluttering down from their perches,
and ran about in dismay, and the little girl ran after them.
I saw it quite plainly, for I looked through a hole in the
hen-house wall. I was angry with the wilful child, and felt
glad when her father came out and scolded her more
violently than yesterday, holding her roughly by the arm.
She held down her head, and her blue eyes were full of
large tears. &lsquo;What are you about here?&rsquo; he asked. She
wept, and said, &lsquo;I wanted to kiss the hen and beg her
pardon for frightening her yesterday; but I was afraid to
tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the father kissed the innocent child&rsquo;s forehead,
and I kissed her on the mouth and eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here ended the story of &ldquo;What the Moon saw,&rdquo; and as
Cissy leaves off reading, mamma says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my darling Cissy, this story does not teach that
it is ever better not to ask forgiveness. The little girl was
only silly for thinking that the hen could understand her,
and so it happened that she only frightened the poor
creature instead of doing any good. If the hen could have
understood her, as little girls understand each other, it
would have been very glad, I daresay, to let her kiss it.
Besides, you see in the story, that directly the father knew
his little girl had meant to ask pardon of the hen, he kissed
her on the forehead, for he saw how good she really was.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c113">SWANS.</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-369dm.jpg" alt="M" width="87" height="150" />
</div>
<p>My little readers all know very well what a
swan is like. Which of you has not seen
the beautiful large bird sailing proudly
on the water; either on some river or lake,
or perhaps on the Serpentine, or round
a pond, in Kensington Gardens? How
graceful the Swan is, with its long arched
neck and pure white plumage! How
grand it looks, turning slowly from side to
side, followed perhaps by one or two cygnets! The mother
swan casts sharp glances round her to see that no one is
daring to interfere with her children. Then, too, how
curiously she thrusts her long neck and head under the
water, seeking for river weeds or some water insect.</p>
<p>In the picture there we see two swans and two growing-up
cygnets. The papa and mamma swans, and one of the
cygnets, are all engaged in obtaining food with their heads
under water. Swans live upon water plants, frogs, and
insects; and some swans get a great deal of bread besides.
Certain little friends of mine, and indeed almost all little
children living at the west end of London, take delight in
carrying out pieces of bread for the swans in Kensington
Gardens. These swans are nearly always gentle to children,
and will come waddling out of the water, and eat
from the children&rsquo;s hands. I must say, however, if swans
could know how awkward they look when waddling about
on dry land, they would never&mdash;at least if they care for
admiration&mdash;show themselves out of their proper element.
They are as awkward and ungainly in all their movements
when on land, as they are graceful in the water. I know
few prettier sights than that of a swan moving lazily along
in summer on some calm lake or river; his reflection just
broken now and then by the tiny wavelets that he makes
in swimming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_368">368</div>
<p>Swans build their nests on the bank of some river or
piece of water, or still more frequently on some small island.
In the nest the mother swan lays six or seven greenish-white
eggs, on which she sits patiently for two months
before the young cygnets appear. She nurses them with
the most tender care, teaching them to swim, and sometimes
carrying them on her back when the water is rough,
or the current strong.</p>
<p>I told you just now how gentle tame swans generally
are, but I must add that they are not always so. They are
anything but gentle if you go near their nests, or their
young ones. When I was a little girl, and was staying at
a country house, where there was a large lake, I had a very
disagreeable adventure with a swan.</p>
<p>I had been feeding some swans in the morning with
bread which I had brought from breakfast. My governess
had taken me down to the lake, and we had found the
beautiful creatures perfectly tame. In the afternoon, after
my early dinner, I took some bread from the table, thinking
I would run down and feed them again. I ran off
alone, for they had been so gentle in the morning it did
not occur to me that there was any danger. Reaching the
edge of the water, I found that my friends whom I had fed
before had gone off to another part of the lake, but there
was a solitary one not far away, sitting among some reeds
upon the bank.</p>
<p>I approached it, and tried to make it come to me by
calling, and by holding out the bread in my hand; but it
took not the slightest notice. Then I threw some bread to
it, when I saw its feathers rising as if it was growing
angry. But I wanted to make it, either come to me, or go
into the water, that I might see it swim; so at last I threw
a piece of hard crust at it, calling out at the same time,&mdash;&ldquo;You
stupid thing, get up.&rdquo; It did get up, and more
quickly than I expected, for it ran at me as fast as it could
waddle, hissing angrily, flapping its wings, and with all its
feathers raised up. I was a tall child of eight years old,
<span class="pb" id="Page_369">369</span>
and could easily have escaped by running, but unluckily I
stumbled and fell just as I turned to run away. The swan
instantly seized my dress in his bill, while he beat me
cruelly with his wings. My screams soon brought a gardener
to the spot, who drove the swan away, but I was
already dreadfully bruised. Then the gardener warned
me solemnly never to go near a sitting swan again: I had
disturbed the poor swan while she was sitting on her eggs.</p>

<p>At the top of this page we have a picture of a black
swan. I daresay you have seen them, for they are common
in England now. They were found in Australia, and are
handsome birds with scarlet bills, but their long necks have
not the graceful curve seen in the white swans.</p>

<h2 id="c115">MAMMA&rsquo;S SUNDAY TALK.<br />MIRACLES OF OUR SAVIOUR:</h2>
<h3>HEALING THE EAR OF MALCHUS.</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i-374dw.jpg" alt="W" width="106" height="139" />
</div>
<p>We come now to the last miracle that
Jesus did before His crucifixion, and
with that I shall finish my description
of them. But you must not suppose,
my dear children, that I have told you
all, or nearly all, the miracles He performed.</p>
<p>The crucifixion itself was marked by
miracles: darkness overspread the land;
the veil, or curtain, which hung before the sanctuary in the
temple, was rent in two; an earthquake tore asunder rocks
and opened graves; but all these were signs and wonders
<span class="pb" id="Page_373">373</span>
sent by God: they hardly can be classed among the miracles
performed by Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Our Saviour&rsquo;s last miracle, then, which I am going to
tell you of to-day, took place at the time of His seizure by
the soldiers and people the night before the crucifixion. I
have already told you, my children, the sad story of our
Saviour&rsquo;s trial and crucifixion: I have told you how He
was arrested during the night in the place called the garden
of Gethsemane, at the foot of Mount Olivet, just outside
Jerusalem. He was there with several of His disciples,
and was praying&mdash;perhaps for those who He knew were
about to inflict upon Him the suffering of a cruel death&mdash;when
some soldiers and a crowd of people, led by the traitor
Judas, approached. What followed is thus described by
St. John:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that should come
upon Him, went forth, and said unto them, &lsquo;Whom seek
ye?&rsquo; They answered Him, &lsquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rsquo; Jesus saith
unto them, &lsquo;I am he.&rsquo; And Judas also, which betrayed
Him, stood with them. As soon, then, as He had said
unto them, &lsquo;I am he,&rsquo; they went backward, and fell to the
ground. Then asked He them again, &lsquo;Whom seek ye?&rsquo;
And they said, &lsquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rsquo; Jesus answered, &lsquo;I
have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let
these go their way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see even at that moment Christ thought of the safety
of His disciples, and in saying, &ldquo;let these go their way,&rdquo;
He was requesting that they might not be arrested with
Him. When He advanced towards the soldiers and people
saying, &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; they were at first so impressed with
the composure and majesty of His Divine presence, that
they started back, and fell prostrate; or, as St. John says,
&ldquo;fell to the ground.&rdquo; This impression, however, passed
quickly away; and, urged on, we may suppose, by the
priests and Pharisees who were with them, they kept to
their purpose of arresting Christ. The miracle which
Jesus then did is thus related by St. Luke:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_374">374</div>
<p>&ldquo;When they which were about Him saw what would
follow, they said unto Him, &lsquo;Lord, shall we smite with the
sword?&rsquo; And one of them smote the servant of the High
Priest, and cut off his right ear. And Jesus answered and
said, &lsquo;Suffer ye thus far.&rsquo; And He touched his ear, and
healed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter was the disciple, as we learn from the other evangelists,
who cut off this man&rsquo;s ear, and the man&rsquo;s name
was Malchus. He was probably one of the most forward
in rudely seizing Jesus: but when he was wounded, the
compassion of the Saviour appeared. &ldquo;Suffer ye thus
far,&rdquo; He cried amidst the strife. They were probably
binding Him with cords, and He asked for a moment&rsquo;s
liberty, that He might touch and heal the wounded man.</p>
<p>A word of reproof was addressed at the same time to the
rash disciple. Our Saviour reminded Peter how easily He
could obtain the protection of legions of angels, if He
wished for any protection or defence at all. &ldquo;But how
then,&rdquo; said He, &ldquo;shall the scriptures be fulfilled?&rdquo; And
He added:&mdash;&ldquo;The cup which my Father hath given me to
drink, shall I not drink it?&rdquo; He would exert no power
to help Himself, but He performed a miracle&mdash;His last
miracle&mdash;to do good to an enemy. After this the disciples
fled, and Jesus was conducted bound into Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We are surprised to find that this miracle did not produce
any conviction of the Divine mission of our Saviour upon
the minds of the priests, Pharisees, and others who witnessed
it: We can only suppose that they had become
familiar with miracles, and that those men whose interest
or pride led them to oppose the teaching of Jesus, tried
to persuade themselves that these miracles were not done
through a power derived from God. Yet the character of
the miracles ought to have removed the possibility of
doubt. Christ exercised His power to do good to the
suffering and afflicted: the sick were healed; the blind
and deaf restored to sight and hearing; the dead brought
back to life.</p>

<p>Our little baby is such a darling! He has curly
golden hair, and great blue eyes, that he opens
very wide. He looks up so earnestly, with such
a solemn look in his eyes sometimes, that you
would fancy he had all the cares of the world to
think about, instead of only what his dinner will
be, and when it will come, like other babies of two years
old. Baby can talk nicely; he says his prayers night and
morning, and before nurse feeds him with his beef-tea, he
will fold his hands, and say his grace after her, as well as
he can in his baby lisp. This is what he says,&mdash;</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
